<p>Do you use more than one browser at a time? Do you ever want to open a link in a browser other than the one you’re currently in?
I’ve already written about <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/08/the-two-browser-recipe-for-increased-productivity/">how I use two browsers to increase productivity</a>. I also wrote a tip on <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/06/30/mac-file-dragging-tip/">efficiently dragging files from one window to another when you have lots of windows open</a>.</p>
<p>Turns, out I can drag links from one browser to another in much the same way I illustrated file dragging.</p>
<h2 id="howtodragalinkfromonebrowsertoanother">How to drag a link from one browser to another</h2>
<p>This example assumes I find the link in Chrome (e.g. in an email), but I want to view it in Safari.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click and begin dragging the link in Chrome.</li>
<li>While still holding down your mouse/trackpad, press Command+Tab.</li>
<li>Drag and point your mouse pointer at the Safari icon in the app switcher.</li>
<li>Release the Command and Tab keys. Safari will appear on top now.</li>
<li>Continue dragging and release on the URL field in Safari.</li>
</ol>
<p>The link will load in Safari.</p>
<p>To better illustrate this simple technique (as well as practice a little screencasting), I put together the following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RbG3n9iCUs">short video using QuickTime X</a>:</p>
