<p>I’ve really gotten into <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build and Analyze</a>, a weekly show about mobile app development with Marco Arment and Dan Benjamin.
I’m not a developer, but I have a deep interest in what’s going on with app development right now. I started following the podcast version of Build and Analyze from show 1, and honestly I wasn’t sure if I would keep it in my subscription list if it got really technical.</p>
<p>Not only have I stayed with it, it’s quickly becoming one of my favorites.</p>
<p>Marco and Dan’s thoughts on the world of mobile apps really transcend the technical, programming aspects of app development. In one of the latest shows, <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/6">#6 Cycles of Motivation</a>, I feel like Marco and Dan are really capturing the spirit of this exciting era of web-based entrepreneurialism, art, and technical expression we’ve entered.</p>
