<p>I wanted to respond to a few comments that readers left on my <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/05/23/s1100/">S1100 ScanSnap post</a>. Plus, I just felt like talking about paperless some more.</p>
<p><strong>Doug asks:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m curious about these receipt scanners. Do you keep the physical receipts, too? I’m just wondering if I ever needed to produce a receipt for some reason whether a printed copy of a scanned image would be acceptable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of my receipts just go straight to an annual file bucket. I only scan receipts that are medical in nature or that I’m likely to need to reproduce (e.g. for flexible spending account documentation).  In my recent experience, I haven’t encountered any company/agency that required original receipts. These days, copies seem to work fine for everyone.</p>
<p>And I do keep a paper copy of everything. Most things get tossed into a single large file. I spend very little time organizing paper files <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/03/07/kitchen-island-zero/">because I access them so infrequently</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Bruce asks:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you happen to use any type of PDF file manipulation software to rearrange pages and/or or delete blank or unwanted pages?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just Preview.  On occasion, I will accidentally scan pages out of order, and sometimes I accidentally put pages in upside down.  If I want to edit a PDF after scanning, I simply open the PDF in Preview, edit, and save. I’ve also used <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/automator/combinepdfs.html">this free Automator workflow</a> to combine PDFs.</p>
<p><strong>Ilhan asks:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does [the S1100] scanner make it easy to scan directly into Evernote when using a Mac?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it’s very easy to scan directly to Evernote using the software Fujitsu includes, but I mostly scan things to a <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/07/28/create-a-file-vault-on-your-mac-with-secure-disk-images/">secure disk image</a>.</p>
<p>I only scan things into Evernote that are 1) “low security”<a id="fnref:f1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f1">1</a> and 2) I will likely need to retrieve on the go.  For example, I’ve started keeping copies of insurance cards in Evernote. Since I don’t carry a wallet, it’s nearly impossible for me to remember to bring along the physical versions of those cards.</p>
<p>It’s not necessary anymore either. Just the other day, I needed to give my dentist an updated copy of my dental insurance card. I simply emailed it from my iPhone as I was standing at the receptionist’s desk.</p>
<h2 id="anoteonocr">A note on OCR</h2>
<p>I know that lots of people want a way to automatically OCR everything they scan.  Personally, I only use OCR on an as needed basis.  It’s actually quite rare that I need to do a text search on a scanned document (as a percentage of everything I scan).  If I need to OCR a scanned PDF, I simply open it in <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/PDFpenPro/">PDFpenPro</a>, and do the OCR there.</p>
<p>For everything else, I just give the file a really verbose name that will make it easy to find.  I also include the scan date in the file name. This makes <em>not</em> finding the file damn near impossible—especially with a little <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/03/28/spotlight/">Spotlight fu</a>.</p>
<h2 id="themainmessage">The main message</h2>
<p>The “all or nothing” mindset is dangerous with paperless workflows. Don’t become a slave to paperless.  I really only scan things that I absolutely do not want to lose (e.g. tax documentation) or that I’m likely to need to retrieve (e.g. EOBs and other medical records).</p>
<p>All of the other paper that invades my home and office either gets trashed or filed in annual buckets.</p>
<p>As with any other system, make sure that your paperless workflow is adding efficiency, not displacing it.</p>

<p>This isn’t a knock against Evernote’s security. It’s just my personality. I don’t (intentionally) put sensitive documents in the cloud unless I have a way of independently encrypting them.<a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:f1"> ↩</a></p>
