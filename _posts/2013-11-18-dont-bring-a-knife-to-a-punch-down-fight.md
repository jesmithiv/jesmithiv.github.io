<p>"You're not gonna do this with a pocket knife."</p>

<p>So says Gabe Weatherhead, the grittiest-DIY-hero-of-geeks you may ever have the pleasure of hearing online, before taking us on a fascinating journey through the conduit of his home network. </p>

<p>As someone who finds himself sewing more and more of his devices together with twisted pairs of copper, I really enjoyed the first episode of Gabe and Erik's new <a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/">Technical Difficulties podcast</a>. And this is just the start. </p>

<p>So put down your pocket knives, kids. Put in your earbuds, and get out your credit cards. </p>
