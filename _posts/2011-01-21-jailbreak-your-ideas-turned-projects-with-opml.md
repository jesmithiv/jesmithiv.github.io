<p>As soon as someone turns up some real unicorn tears, they'll surely use them to make a Mac productivity application that handles everything for usâ€”from idea to shipped product.
You can keep longing for that day, or you can read David Sparks's <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/1/18/dancing-with-opml.html">excellent post on OPML</a>, the lingua franca of several great Mac applications.</p>
<blockquote><p>What you need is a standard that allows you to transfer your human thoughts between multiple digital applications. Specifically, a way to get your thoughts, outline, and mind map ported directly into your word tools. This is exactly what OPML does and THAT is what makes it awesome.</p></blockquote>
<p>Use the right tool for the job at each step, and profit.</p>
