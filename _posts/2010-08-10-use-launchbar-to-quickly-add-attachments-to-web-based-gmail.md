<p>I love finding great ways of using things together. Parts of a workflow become a lot more powerful than their innate selves when combined other things that complement them.
A simple example:</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gmail in a web browser</li>
<li>LaunchBar</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>If you're composing an email using the web interface for Gmail, and you want to attach a file:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use LaunchBar to navigate to that file (the fastest way to browse your Mac in my opinion).</li>
<li>Use your mouse to drag the file from LaunchBar's dropdown file menu to Gmail in your browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the fastest way to add an attachment to a browser-composed email that I've found so far. I typically think of LaunchBar as a keyboard-only tool, but the fact that you can drag and drop files from it's drop-down window makes LaunchBar even more versatile and a great mate for web-based Gmail.</p>
