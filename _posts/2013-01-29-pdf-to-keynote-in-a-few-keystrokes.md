<p>I have an uncommon-to-most but highly frequent-for-me workflow where I convert PDF slides created from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_" title="LaTeX">LaTeX Beamer package</a> to Keynote presentations, which I use in my actuarial education work.</p>

<p>The PDF to Keynote step happens very quickly thanks to an app of the same name: <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/21623/pdf-to-keynote">PDF to Keynote.app</a>. I created <a href="https://vimeo.com/58369489">a short video</a> illustrating how I use this app with <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a>.</p>
