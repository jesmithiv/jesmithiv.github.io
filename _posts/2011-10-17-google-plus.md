<p>When Katie Floyd <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2011/09/mpu-058-the-google-lifestyle/">mentioned</a> that she was having a hard time working Google+ into her life, I felt better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m struggling with it, too. I&#8217;ve done nearly nothing there since signing up.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t deny that Google+ has a lot of potential or that it&#8217;s better than Facebook or that it fills a niche that wasn&#8217;t already filled. I just can&#8217;t make it a priority right now, and I honestly feel kinda bad about that.</p>
<p>New people follow me on Google+ nearly every day it seems, and some people have said some really nice things about PE posts there. I feel like a jerk for not responding to Google+ feedback like I normally do on Twitter, which is really the only &#8220;social network&#8221; I visit regularly anymore.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t interpret my Google+ non-presence in a bad way. I may get there eventually, but I just haven&#8217;t figured out howâ€”yet.</p>
