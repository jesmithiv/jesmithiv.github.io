<p>Graeme Wood <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/05/01/what_will_happen_to_us/?page=full">ponders</a> what might come of us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most humans who have ever lived have died in conditions almost exactly like the ones into which they were born, and without written history had no way to grasp that the future might be different at all. Only now have we gained the scientific knowledge necessary to appreciate how exactly how deep a rabbit-hole the future really is: not just long enough to see empires rise and crumble, but long enough to make all human history so far seem like a sneeze of the gods.</p>
