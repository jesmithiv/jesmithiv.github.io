<blockquote>
<p>Being wrong isn&#8217;t fatal, it&#8217;s merely something we&#8217;d prefer to avoid. We have the privilege of being wrong. Not being wrong on purpose, of course, but wrong as a cost on the way to being right.</p>

<p>I totally <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/12/15/dont-be-afraid-to-ask-fewer-questions/">agree</a>.</p>
