<p>I had the great fun and honor of joining buddies Gabe Weatherhead and Erik Hess on <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2013/7/23/044-facing-email-with-eddie-smith.html">the Generational podcast</a>. We talked about email, but instead of swimming with the usual email narrative currents, we talked about how we actually like email.</p>

<p>So far I haven't received any death threats, and the universe seems to be intact. So far. </p>
