<p>Telling someone how to be creative is like explaining how the color blue tastes. Oh God. Here I go.</p><p>So you think everyone wants to be more creative? I don’t.</p><p>I don’t think it’s creativity most people seek. No, people want to be more like post-creative&nbsp;<em>people</em>. People are nothing if not jealous of the success of others, especially over here in the arbitrarily westernmost side of the planet.</p><p>Creatives just have this highly coveted form of social capital. Creative success echoes envy in six words: “Why didn’t I think of that?”</p><p>I have no sympathy for people who only seek the rewards of success, so I'll turn my attention to those that really&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;want to be more creative. I'll disappoint them instead.</p><p>The mechanics of creativity are actually pretty dull, I think. Creative people are dull, too. My most creative endeavors were either accidents or the result of unremarkable, unannounced work.</p><p>Apple exemplifies creativity in two key ways:</p><ol><li>They combine elements into previously nonexistent forms&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;asking anyone’s permission or acceptance.</li><li>They don’t tell anyone until they’re done and ready to ship.</li></ol><p>I’ve never been in Apple’s shop, but I bet it doesn’t look like Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. Creativity isn’t magic.</p><p>Or, maybe it is. Especially if we take (great) magic for what it really is: the product of hard, obsessive, secretive work. The kind of work few people are willing to engage. Expert magician Teller&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Teller-Reveals-His-Secrets.html">explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>You will be fooled by a trick if it involves more time, money and practice than you (or any other sane onlooker) would be willing to invest. My partner, Penn, and I once produced 500 live cockroaches from a top hat on the desk of talk-show host David Letterman. To prepare this took weeks. We hired an entomologist who provided slow-moving, camera-friendly cockroaches… Then we built a secret compartment out of foam-core (one of the few materials cockroaches can’t cling to) and worked out a devious routine for sneaking the compartment into the hat. More trouble than the trick was worth? To you, probably. But not to magicians.</p></blockquote><p>The unveiling of a creative outcome is not that different than a magician’s performance. Magic pleasingly assaults expectation. It surprises.</p><p>Creativity, like magic, exists in at least two planes of reality: that of the creator and that of the creator's audience. In other words, the surprise maker and the surprised.</p><p>The purest form of creativity, I think, is the release of unsolicited things into the world. We’ve all heard the Henry Ford quote:</p><blockquote><p>If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/08/henry_ford_never_said_the_fast.html">Whether or not</a>&nbsp;he really said that, I think it exudes the essence of creativity.</p><p>Pure creativity cannot be solicited. It’s there until you look for it—like a subatomic particle. As soon as you summon creativity, it’s gone. Like a busted magic trick.</p><p>I can’t tell you what blue tastes like.</p><p><em>But</em>&nbsp;I can come up with a lot of things it doesn’t taste like. So…</p><p>If you&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;want to be a creative writer, you should try your best to</p><ol><li>Write things that have already been written.</li><li>Tell as many people as possible about what you’re writing before you’re done.</li></ol><p>If you&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;want to be a creative product company, you should try your best to</p><ol><li>Make products that have already been made.</li><li>Tell as many people as possible about what you’re making before you’re ready to ship it.</li></ol><p>If&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;you want to be a better cubicle worker, you should try your best to</p><ol><li>Be like everyone else, meet your boss’s expectations, and always ask permission.</li><li>Announce ideas as soon as they pop into your head.</li></ol><p>The process of creativity isn’t glamorous. It’s simply about hard work, the management of emotions, and&nbsp;delayed showmanship. And it's necessarily lonely. To want to be creative—<em>truly</em>&nbsp;creative—is to want to entertain, which is often depressingly opposite of being entertained.&nbsp;</p><p>Real creativity is the dull and failure-fraught art of giving people things they never asked for. Out of the blue.</p><p>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stańczyk"><em>Stańczyk</em>&nbsp;via Wikipedia</a>]&nbsp;</p><p></p>
