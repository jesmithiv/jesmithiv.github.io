<p>This morning was hard. A lot harder than Friday. Maybe it was the noticeable look of grief on the faces of other parents as I walked into my son’s day care. Maybe it was his teacher telling me that they’re going to start locking the classroom doors from now on.</p>

<p>Maybe it was how I suddenly became aware of this invisible but intensely palpable collective grief, fear, and sadness being felt by a million other parents at that very moment in time as they dropped their kids off at school.</p>

<p>This is the part of parenting they don’t tell you about. And they shouldn’t.</p>

<p>It was almost too perfect hearing John Lennon on the radio as I drove away from my son this morning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A very merry Christmas<br>
And a happy New Year<br>
Let’s hope it’s a good one<br>
Without any fear<br>
And so this is Christmas<br>
For weak and for strong<br>
For rich and the poor ones<br>
The world is so wrong </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is, but line four is the one to hang on. As are your memories. No terrorist can rob you of those. Act <em>today</em> in a way that creates as many positive experiences as you can.</p>
