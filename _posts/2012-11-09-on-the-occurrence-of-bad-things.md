<p>When something bad happens, people usually offer a common consolation: "Things happen for a reason." I don't believe that.</p>

<p>I believe that you are the multiplicative product of all of your past experiences. You <em>are</em> your experiences and you are what you <em>do</em> with those experiences. I also believe the most difficult experiences in your past account for your best qualities today.</p>

<p>Things <em>don't</em> happen for a reason. They happen for <em>you</em>.</p>
