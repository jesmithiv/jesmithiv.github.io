<p>From a <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130222/physically-together-heres-the-internal-yahoo-no-work-from-home-memo-which-extends-beyond-remote-workers/#sthash.WfvqpYyR.dpuf">recent memo</a> to Yahoo employees announcing CEO Marissa Mayer's decision to ban all remote work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To become the absolute best place to work, communication and collaboration will be important, so we need to be working side-by-side. That is why it is critical that we are all present in our offices. Some of the best decisions and insights come from hallway and cafeteria discussions, meeting new people, and impromptu team meetings. Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home. We need to be one Yahoo!, and that starts with physically being together. </p>

<p>Steve Wozniak in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393330435/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393330435&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=practiceffici-20">iWoz</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most inventors and engineers I’ve met are like me— they’re shy and they live in their heads. They’re almost like artists. In fact, the very best of them are artists. And artists work best alone where they can control an invention’s design without a lot of other people designing it for marketing or some other committee. I don’t believe anything really revolutionary has been invented by committee. If you’re that rare engineer who’s an inventor and also an artist, I’m going to give you some advice that might be hard to take. That advice is: Work alone. You’re going to be best able to design revolutionary products and features if you’re working on your own. Not on a committee. Not on a team.</p>

<p>And finally, Susan Cain in Chapter 3, "When Collaboration Kills Creativity", arguably the most powerful chapter in her entire book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307352153/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307352153&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=practiceffici-20">Quiet</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open-plan offices have been found to reduce productivity and impair memory. They’re associated with high staff turnover. They make people sick, hostile, unmotivated, and insecure. Open-plan workers are more likely to suffer from high blood pressure and elevated stress levels and to get the flu; they argue more with their colleagues; they worry about coworkers eavesdropping on their phone calls and spying on their computer screens. They have fewer personal and confidential conversations with colleagues. They’re often subject to loud and uncontrollable noise, which raises heart rates; releases cortisol, the body’s fight-or-flight “stress” hormone; and makes people socially distant, quick to anger, aggressive, and slow to help others. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Susan Cain's book is easily one of the best pieces of non-fiction I've read in the last five years. If you manage people or simply value personal productivity, consider yourself at a competitive disadvantage if you don't at least consider the arguments she presents.</p>
