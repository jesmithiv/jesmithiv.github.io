title: Decoupling the original vision
---

Efficient creative work at the edge of the [adjacent possible][ap] is basically:

1. Envisioning your dream home fully built
2. Finding the most elemental materials to build it
3. Building a completely different and better home than you ever could have imagined

*Inefficient* creative work is the failure to release the original visionâ€”the false notion that you can know in advance what lies beyond the been-done-before.
