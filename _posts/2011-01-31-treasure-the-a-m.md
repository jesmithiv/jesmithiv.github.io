<blockquote>There is something magical about the early morning. Itâ€™s a time when the world belongs to only those few who are awake. And we walk around like kings while others remain unseen in their beds.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the secret I discovered for myself in late 2009. It's enabled me to boost my income with a side job, write for this site, and chase down many other highly worthwhile pursuits that would have easily eluded my late-day, mushy brain.</p>
<p>My head is just different in the early morning. It's calm, focused, and resigned to be on task. If you have a hobby or special interest, I recommend meeting with it first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>There's no alarm clock like passion.</p>
