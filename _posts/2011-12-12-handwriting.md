title: Why I still use paper and pens

<p>I keep seeing articles debating the use versus non-use of handwriting in the post-PC era. Personally, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever figure out a way of making handwriting totally obsolete. It&#8217;s just too organic, natural, and cozy-feeling to make ink trails on a page without the aid of an electronic device.</p>
<p>I find handwriting useful in at least two settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>In meetings</li>
<li>While problem-solving</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="handwritinginmeetings">Handwriting in meetings</h2>
<p><a href="http://michaelschechter.me/better-approach-to-meeting-notes/">Michael Schechter</a> pointed me to Stephen Hackett&#8217;s <a href="http://512pixels.net/the-capture-form/">capture form</a>—a template with a 2x2 grid of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reference information</li>
<li>Meeting notes</li>
<li>Action items for others</li>
<li>Action items for me (i.e. the note-taker)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stephen also made a handy <a href="http://512pixels.net/capture-form-textexpander/">TextExpander snippet</a>.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never used a formal template like this, but you might find it useful. I like how Stephen&#8217;s form identifies the most important takeaways from most any meeting. It makes post-meeting processing easier. That&#8217;s a good thing because I think the most people suck at turning notes into action.</p>
<p>I still prefer <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/tag/mind-mapping/">mind maps</a>. I like writing all over a page, in no linear order. As tasks bubble to the surface of the mind map, I mark them with a box (symbolizing a checkbox). This makes it easy to enter the actions—which often need additional editing—into OmniFocus later.</p>
<p><a href="http://michaelschechter.me/better-approach-to-meeting-notes/">Michael&#8217;s post-meeting process</a> mirrors mine pretty closely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After each meeting, my action items are entered into OmniFocus (or completed if they only take a few minutes), I email or explain tasks to others, scan the form into Evernote for reference and shred the paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="doodlingmywayoutofproblems">Doodling my way out of problems</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m an actuary, and my job involves tackling complex quantitative problems. I have an extensive background in mathematics, but I&#8217;ve learned that real problem-solving is much more about art than mechanistic number-crunching.</p>
<p>Problem-solving is an organic mental exercise: A messy, flawed, no-one-way-of-doing-things dance across a gradient that flows from knowing less to knowing more.</p>
<p>For me, handwriting, more specifically, <em>doodling</em>, is an artistic lever in the problem-solving I do. It&#8217;s a way of staying active while sorting through different scenarios.</p>
<p>Doodling expert <a href="http://sunnibrown.com/">Sunni Brown</a> explains the utility of doodling beautifully in <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/the-miseducation-of-the-doodle/">&#8220;The Miseducation of the Doodle&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doodling may be better described as ‘markings to help a person think.’ Most people believe that doodling requires the intellectual mind to shutdown, but this is one misrepresentation that needs correcting. There is no such thing as a mindless doodle. The act of doodling is the mind’s attempt to engage before succumbing to mindlessness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you find yourself staring at a problem on a screen—of any size—without taking any action for more than five minutes or so, pen and paper might be your ticket out.</p>
<p>When you move your hand, you move your mind.</p>
