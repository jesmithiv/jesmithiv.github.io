<p>David Sparks did a great job <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/2/6/supercharge-textexpander.html">summarizing</a> the <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/tag/textexpander/">amazing tricks</a> of TextExpander shell script magician Brett Terpstra. I was thinking about doing the same, but I've been too busy playing with, or rather <em>implementing</em>, them in my workflow. Ahem.
Dr. Drang also offered his own, decidedly more <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/02/dissociated-darwin/">Darwinian take</a>, on the matter.</p>
<p>And saving the least sophisticated for last, I've written up a few of my own TextExpander Markdown automations in the past (a<a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/07/13/using-textexpander-and-notational-velocity-for-fast-efficient-writing/"> few for Mac OS X</a> and <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/10/10/markdownmail-for-ipad-is-a-mobile-web-writers-dream-come-true/">a few for the iPad</a>).</p>
<p>I've also got an interesting-to-me TextExpander + Hazel workflow story queued up for this week, so stay tuned for that—or put on your geek-speak ear muffs if this is all too much for you.</p>
