title: More macOS Preview PDF trouble
---

[Brooks Duncan](http://www.documentsnap.com/ocr-text-macos-sierra-preview/) performed several tests to confirm that Preview on macOS Sierra 12.12.2 destroys the OCR text layer of certain PDFs.

I've been extremely happy with [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com) as my default PDF app for macOS. I promoted it to my primary PDF app soon after upgrading to Sierra because I noticed that Preview would also break the internal table of contents structure of PDFs. 

I never thought I'd see the day when I couldn't even trust something as basic as a PDF to Apple's software. The new PDFkit stuff in Sierra should be an embarrassment to Apple. PDF support should *just work*.
