<p>In an effort to
<ul>
<li>make you, the reader of this web site, happier,</li>
<li>satisfy my ongoing urge to do mildly fiddly things with CSS, and</li>
<li>most importantly, give away something really cool like <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/PDFpenPro/index.html">PDFpenPro</a> for FREE,</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm doing a survey. Huh? Just wait a second, but yes, you read that last bullet right. The awesome folks at Smile have agreed to give away a license for one of my all-time favorite Mac applications, PDFpenPro (normally $99.95).</p>
<p>Okay, okay. Settle down.  Let me tell you how this is going to work.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about running all the serifs out of this here web site and going with a cleaner font that may just be more readable than what's here now.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<h2 style="font-family: 'Open Sans';">5, 4, 3, 2, 1. . . Open Sans</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', serif; font-size: 14 pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-shadow: none; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; letter-spacing: 0em; word-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.4;"><em><strong>Update: </strong>Apparently Google Fonts, including this  one, don't always get along well with with Firefox in Windows, so you  may not be seeing what you're supposed to see. Sorry about that.</em></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', serif; font-size: 14 pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-shadow: none; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; letter-spacing: 0em; word-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.4;">Be sure to leave your cozy RSS app for a minute and actually visit http://www.practicallyefficient.com directly because this text is in a different font than the previous paragraphs.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', serif; font-size: 14 pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-shadow: none; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; letter-spacing: 0em; word-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.4;">I'm not going to get all fancy schmancy with font talk because honestly I'd be pretending to know something about stuff I don't.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', serif; font-size: 14 pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-shadow: none; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; letter-spacing: 0em; word-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.4;">I just want to make Practically Efficient as readable as possible. Period. End of agenda.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', serif; font-size: 14 pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-shadow: none; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; letter-spacing: 0em; word-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.4;">But before I just up and made the change, it occurred to me that you might want some say in the matter. After all, you read this thing. <strong>So I'm taking a poll—<a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dGlzYUdxaFVlemNmTXBERlJKQUlZYUE6MQ#gid=0">a super simple, one-question survey</a>—to see which you would prefer: what's been here a while now (Georgia), or what you're reading right now (Open Sans).</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', serif; font-size: 14 pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-shadow: none; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; letter-spacing: 0em; word-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.4;">Be sure to provide your email address when you vote if you want to be entered in the drawing for a free PDFpenPro license. I will randomly select the winner on Saturday, June 4, so cast your vote before then.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', serif; font-size: 14 pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-shadow: none; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; letter-spacing: 0em; word-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.4;">Unfortunately only one person will win a free PDFpenPro license, but if you work with PDF on your Mac often, I highly recommend at least trying out a trial copy of PDFpen or PDFpenPro. It offers a powerful set of features at just a fraction of the cost of Adobe Acrobat for Mac. I use it regularly to fill out PDF forms, annotate PDF, OCR (<a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/01/26/how-to-collect-kindle-quotations-using-pdfpen/">creatively sometimes</a>),  <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/27/think-and-redact-before-you-send/">redact sensitive parts of PDF</a>, and even encrypt PDF.</p>
