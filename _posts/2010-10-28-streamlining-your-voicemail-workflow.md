<p>Doug, a PE reader that I recently had the pleasure of meeting through email, showed me how he <a href="http://www.douglane.com/2010/10/pulling-the-plug-on-the-phone-company/">pulled the plug on his home phone</a>. Go check it out.
I think it’s a great example of how you can rid your life and workflows of nuisances that you may implicitly accept now.  Specifically, unwanted “junk” calls.</p>
<p>It’s also a great example of using modern technology to cheaply consolidate and simplify your life.</p>
<p>I’ve not managed to ditch my landline yet, but I have whittled the cost down to a reasonable amount.  More importantly, I’m auto-forwarding all inbound calls to a Google Voice number.</p>
<p>Though I’ve not given out my Google Voice number to anyone, I’m using it to create a unified voice mailbox.  All of my voicemails go to that same spot.  The best part is that I rarely have to listen to voice messages.</p>
<p>Google transcribes the messages and sends them to me via email.  I’d much rather read a telemarketer’s call and delete it than have to listen to it over a phone.</p>
<p>I guess it's one way that email is giving back to older forms of communication.</p>
<p>Feel free to share your own tips for streamlining phone and voicemail workflows.</p>
