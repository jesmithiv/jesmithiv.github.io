<p>If you interpret the <a href="http://kottke.org/14/11/fantastic-1970s-letter-from-lego-to-parents">1970s Lego parent letter</a> as anything other than a sales tactic, youâ€™re giving Lego too much credit. If I'm handing out a medal for the most gender-progressive company of the 20th century, I'm extending a hand to Slinky first. Beginning in the late 1960s, they jingled it clear for decades: this industrial spring is fun for a <em>girl and a boy</em>. </p>

<p>I will say, however, that my son and daughter enjoy Legos equally, and until today, I hadn't given it much thought. Maybe that in itself is the greatest sign of progress.</p>
