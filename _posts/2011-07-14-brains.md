<p>In the more recent years of my stay topside terra firma, I’ve come to view my rural upbringing as one of the greatest assets I possess.  Now, I learn that maybe it’s helping keep that pesky <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/07/19/fighting-the-war-on-terror-in-our-heads/">lizard brain</a> at bay, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18864354">The Economist</a> reports on a study that compared primitive brain parts between city and rural dwellers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People living in the countryside had the lowest levels of activity in their amygdalas. Those living in towns had higher levels. City dwellers had the highest. . . In the case of the pACC, however, what mattered was not where someone was living now, but where he or she was brought up. The more urban a person’s childhood, the more active his pACC, regardless of where he was dwelling at the time of the experiment.</p>
