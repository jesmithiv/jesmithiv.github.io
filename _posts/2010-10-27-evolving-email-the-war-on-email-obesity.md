<p><em><a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/tag/evolving-email">Evolving email</a> is a series about putting yourself in the inbox of the recipient and getting more value out of the time you spend on the task of writing email.</em>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>It’s 4:00 PM, and a you're at work. A 600-word email lands in your inbox. Your heart fills with happiness, your eyes with tears of joy. You can't wait to read it. Maybe you even print it out, make a cup of coffee, and curl up on a sofa to enjoy reading it like your favorite book.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Honestly, I find it very hard to actually read a long email in its entirety (unless of course it's from PE readers, some of the most thoughtful, well-spoken folks in the world). I have particular disdain for bloated emails at work, where messages accumulate like the October oak leaves in my yard right now.</p>
<p>Instead of eagerly reading a long, unsolicited email, I usually scan it.  I’m not alone.</p>
<h2 id="youreyessayitall">Your eyes say it all</h2>
<p>Geek alert: I would be very interested to see a study of how people read email – especially in a work setting – but I’ve been unable to find any such studies.  (If you find one, let me know.)</p>
<p>I did, however, find a <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/newsletters.html">study</a> by Jakob Nielsen that tracked  eye movement over email newsletters.</p>
<p>The following “heat map” indicates where people’s eyes spent the most time. Red is the longest, followed by yellow, then blue:</p>
<p><a href="/img/newsletter_heatmap-pe.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1864" title="newsletter_heatmap-pe" src="/img/newsletter_heatmap-pe.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="548" /></a></p>
<p>It’s clear that these things attract attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>First paragraph</li>
<li>Headers</li>
<li>Images</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s important to me is not really what people see, but what they don’t.  The body of a long email is icy blue. It’s pretty chilly out there.</p>
<p>Hold that thought.</p>
<h2 id="thevalueofanother100words">The value of another 100 words</h2>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/percent-text-read.html">different analysis</a>, Nielsen also examined how people read web pages. While this second study wasn’t aimed email, I think the concept is easily extended.</p>
<p>He notes that while people certainly spend more time on pages with more words, they only spend 4.4 more seconds for each additional 100 words.</p>
<p>Nielsen also found that the more words a web page has, the fewer words people read as a percentage of the total.  It falls very rapidly between 0 and 200 words, too.</p>
<p>In fact, if you want people to read even half of your page, it should have 111 words or less.</p>
<p>Nielsen concludes that users will only read 20% of the text on the average web page.</p>
<h2 id="whatdoesallthismean">What does all this mean?</h2>
<p>The precision of the numbers in Nielsen’s studies aren’t that important to me.  The concepts, however, are.</p>
<p>Here’s the most important one: <strong>The more you write in a single email, the more you’re wasting your time.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s define a long email as 600 words. And let’s assume that Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute">is correct</a> that the average person types at a rate of 19 words per minute. At that rate, it takes a little over a half hour for the average person to generate a 600-word email. Damn.</p>
<p>So… if you’re spending a lot of time writing things that people aren’t reading anyway, why write them? Why not spend that time on more productive pursuits?</p>
<h2 id="practicallyefficientstepsforimprovement">Three practically efficient steps for improvement</h2>
<h3 id="step1:recognizetheproblem">Step 1: Recognize the problem</h3>
<p>I don’t think anyone ever clicks the “new message” button with the intention of pounding out a novella.  Somewhere between realizing that the email needs to be sent and reaching the last line, it just kinda happens.</p>
<p>When it does happen, <strong>stop</strong>.  Don’t click send.</p>
<h3 id="step2:getoutyourknife">Step 2: Get out your knife</h3>
<p>Instead of going for your throat, quickly scan the email, reading the first line of each paragraph.  Think about what <em>you</em> would do if someone sent you this monster.  Does your message come across?</p>
<p>Cut out the junk that isn’t needed. Or, find the really important parts, and copy them into a new message.  Think of that long email as a first draft. Throw it away.</p>
<p>In the end, create a final product that has a high ratio of information to words. Make your message count.</p>
<h3 id="step3:avoidtheprobleminthefuturemostimportant">Step 3: Avoid the problem in the future (most important)</h3>
<p>The next time you need to write an email – especially in a work situation where important information is being conveyed – try writing your email as a super bare bones outline first.</p>
<p>You can likely save huge amounts of time by simply outlining your thoughts for 30 seconds before releasing the diarrhea of your consciousness into your recipient’s inbox.</p>
<p>Maybe something like this:</p>
<pre><code>* Sales results are in
    * 20% growth

* My interpretations
    * Lower than expected
    * Growth still improving quarter over quarter
    * Better than 2 out of 3 competitors

* Questions/caveats
    * Not sure about data from division 5
    * What are your thoughts?</code></pre>
<p>Once you have an outline, you’ll probably find that you only need a few more words to make it readable (maybe none at all).</p>
<p>In fact, I increasingly leave my emails in an outline form because I think it’s so much easier to digest than stacks of paragraphs – especially when numbers are involved.  The * symbol is everyone’s best friend.</p>
<h2 id="summaryinoutline">Summary, in outline</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you accidentally write a morbidly obese email, cut the fat before sending.</li>
<li>Rapidly outline emails that involve combinations of numbers, important information, thoughts, and questions.</li>
<li>By writing email more efficiently, you can repurpose your time to more productive or enjoyable endeavors.</li>
<li>By sending emails that are more likely to be read, you become a more effective communicator.</li>
<li>Your coworkers may learn by example and return the favor.</li>
<li>Remember: People read email for information, not pleasure. Outlines are good at communicating information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ironically and by poor example, I have more to say on long emails, but this post is already plenty long enough, so I’ll do that down the road in this series.</p>
<p>How do you keep your emails lean?</p>
