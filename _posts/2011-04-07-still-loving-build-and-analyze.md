<p>As if the pace of mobile app and web innovation isn't mind-blowing enough, how great is it that we live in a time when we can listen to the best minds in the biz talk out loud? That's just what Dan Benjamin and Marco Arment do on <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">5by5's Build and Analyze</a>. I've been subscribing to this show since its birth, and it remains one of my favorites.
<a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/18">Episode 18</a>, "Second Crack," is a must-listen for anyone remotely interested in the future of web publishing platforms. I think static just came back in style.</p>
