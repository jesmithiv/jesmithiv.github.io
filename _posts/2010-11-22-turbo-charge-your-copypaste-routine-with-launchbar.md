<p>Copying and pasting is as fundamental to life in front of a computer screen as pressing the gas and brake pedal when driving a car.  It’s boring and not very noteworthy. But that’s not going to keep me from talking about it. Oh, no. Not at all.
If you do a lot of copying and pasting, you might be able to get even better at it by using a clipboard history utility. My favorite is the one that comes with <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a>.</p>
<p>How come you say? Well, ‘cause I</p>
<ul>
<li>like making refinements to repetitious activities,</li>
<li>copy and paste stuff a lot,</li>
<li>have a fondness for keyboard shortcuts,</li>
<li>like pasting plain text free of formatting and other gunk,</li>
<li>write bookoodles of stuff in Markdown and <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/07/13/using-textexpander-and-notational-velocity-for-fast-efficient-writing/">like automating it</a>, and</li>
<li>I like quickly building lists of items that can be pasted into emails, documents, text files, and all sorts of other places where lists are welcome.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ahistoryoftheclipboardlaunchbarstyle">A history of the clipboard, LaunchBar style</h2>
<p>Most of the following comes straight from LaunchBar’s <a href="http://www.obdev.at/resources/launchbar/help/ClipboardHistory.html">Clipboard History help page</a> with the seasoning of my own experience sprinkled on for extra flavor.</p>
<p><strong>My LaunchBar clipboard settings</strong></p>
<p><a href="/img/LaunchBar-clipboard-history-pe.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2148" title="LaunchBar-clipboard-history-pe" src="/img/LaunchBar-clipboard-history-pe.png" alt="" width="558" height="540" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The keyboard shortcut</strong></p>
<p>By default, Command-\ invokes LaunchBar’s clipboard history.</p>
<p><a href="/img/LaunchBar-clipboard-history-pe-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2149" title="LaunchBar-clipboard-history-pe-1" src="/img/LaunchBar-clipboard-history-pe-1.png" alt="" width="455" height="221" /></a></p>
<p>After invoking, continue holding Command, and use your up and down arrow keys to move through the list. Select the item you want, and release the keys to paste.</p>
<p>Quite often, I find myself copying multiple things from the same source. For example, I often need to copy both a web page's title and its URL. Instead of flipping back and forth twice, I can do both copies back-to-back, then retrieve them from the clipboard history in the order I need.</p>
<p>In general, I find that the less I'm switching between windows, the more efficient I am.</p>
<p><strong>Pasting plain text</strong></p>
<p>It’s exceedingly rare that I want to paste text <em>with</em> formatting. Normally, all I want is the plain, unadulterated stuff.</p>
<p>Checking “As Plain Text” means that no formatting will travel with your text to its ultimate destination. But fear not: you can still paste formatting by pressing the Option key.</p>
<p>The nice thing about keeping “As Plain Text” checked is that, for me anyway, Command-\ has become a substitute for Command-V (the default keyboard shortcut for pasting).</p>
<p><strong>Merging clipboard items</strong></p>
<p>This is where you can really give your copy/paste productivity a turbo boost.  I use clipboard merge to quickly build lists of things. You might want to, too.</p>
<p>To merge items, press Command-C to copy the first item, then Command-C Command-C (twice, that is) to merge successive items with existing items. Each successive item will be stacked like:</p>
<pre><code>First chunk of text
Second chunk of text
Third chunk of text</code></pre>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>This is a super handy way to compile of list of disjointed items from a PDF, web page, etc.</p>
<p><strong>File operations</strong></p>
<p>I use LaunchBar to quickly navigate through folders on my Mac. I also use it frequently to move and copy files to and fro.  Until very recently, however, I thought that I could only work with one file at a time. Oh, silly me.</p>
<p>To select multiple files with LaunchBar, select the first file by pressing Command-C, then select additional files by pressing Command-C-C for each one. You can even do this with files in different folders!</p>
<p>Once you have all the files you want, you can do several useful things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paste onto a folder to copy the files to that folder.</li>
<li>Paste into a Mail window to attach them to the message.</li>
<li>Press Command-Shift-V in LaunchBar to select these files.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last one is particularly interesting; I discovered it only recently. Command-Shift-V tells LaunchBar that you want to do something with the files <em>using</em> LaunchBar.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with moving copying and moving files using LaunchBar, you know that process is basically this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select file in LaunchBar</li>
<li>Press Tab</li>
<li>Type an “operation.” For example, type an application name, then Return to open with that app; navigate to folder, then Return to copy/move file to that folder; type email contact and Return to attach to message; and more.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you’ve pressed Command-Shift-V, you can pick up at step 2 above, and it works exactly the same way.</p>
<p>In other words, Command-Shift-V is the ticket to working with multiple files at once – something that I previously thought <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/quicksilvers-comma-trick/">only Quicksilver could do</a>.</p>
