<p>I've been really pleased with the response I've received to my <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/29/a-call-for-folks-interested-in-working-on-notational-velocity/">call for folks interested in working on Notational Velocity</a>.
In particular, Christian Tietze, is really doing a great job with his Notational Velocity development.  Please support him by downloading <a href="http://christiantietze.tumblr.com/post/1285929970/nv-mmd-hud">his latest version</a> and giving him feedback using the details he provided on his site.  You can also leave Christian feedback <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/29/a-call-for-folks-interested-in-working-on-notational-velocity/">here</a> at PE in the comments section or drop your own ideas for Notational Velocity features.</p>
<p>I've been personally testing Christian's versions of Notational Velocity, and they are coming along nicely. His latest build supports MultiMarkdown, and he's added a "heads-up display" (HUD), which is a preview window of the HTML (like QuickLook on your Mac).</p>
<p>Great work, Christian!</p>
