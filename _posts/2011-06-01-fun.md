<p>I was thinking about games at work <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/03/21/all-games-and-no-play/">earlier this year</a>. I think Saul Kaplan gets at the heart of why <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/05/if_all_of_work_were_gamified.html">productive gaming</a> is worth pursuing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Organizations have a lot of experience with goal setting, rules, and incentives. What we havenâ€™t figured out is how to align work with personal passion and commitment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many opportunities to introduce productive gaming, even in large corporate factories. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market">Prediction markets</a>, for one.</p>
<p>The key, I think, is to figure out how to tap the enormous amount of passionate, pent-up energy a normal human employee carries around. What if even a few ounces of that energy could be aimed at a goal common to the employee and employer? What if money wasn't the only thing that motivated your employees to come in every day?</p>
