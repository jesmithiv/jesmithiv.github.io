<p>I wanted to share a tip I recently read at <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a>. Apparently one of Lifehacker’s readers submitted this idea in a comment on one of Lifehacker’s posts.
The idea is shift your fingers to the left or right when you type your easy-to-remember password.  So let’s say you want your password to be something really common like “florida.”  If you shift each finger to the right one key, it becomes g;ptofs, which is a pretty decent, meaningless password.</p>
