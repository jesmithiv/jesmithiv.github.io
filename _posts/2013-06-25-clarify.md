<p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2013/06/23/mac-power-users-143-rss-and-replacing-google-reader/">that last Mac Power Users episode</a>, my favorite podcasting pair, David and Katie, mentioned a great Mac app called <a href="http://www.clarify-it.com">Clarify</a>.</p>

<p>Clarify is the kind of software I would selfishly create for myself if I were a developer. It makes organizing and sharing screenshots so easy I laugh a little bit at my pre-Clarify life each time I use it.</p>

<p>If you routinely send people screenshots—especially multiple screenshots—to show them how to do things, you should buy Clarify. This post should really end here, but for you not-too-busy folks, there's more. . .</p>

<p>Before Clarify, I would take several screenshots, then label the file names sequentially like <code>step 1</code>, <code>step 2</code>, etc., then open each one in Preview or some other annotation program and put circles, boxes, and text on the images. Then I'd attach them all to an email.</p>

<p>Now that workflow seems akin to clubbing a cow when I want a hamburger.</p>

<p>With Clarify, I just take the screenshots and drag them in. It automatically sorts them by time so they're already in the right order. After that, I can label/annotate each. When I'm done, I can PDF it, send it to Evernote, or copy the whole "document" to my clipboard.</p>

<p>The end product looks ridiculously professional, too. </p>
