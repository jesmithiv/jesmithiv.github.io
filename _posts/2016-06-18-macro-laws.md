title: Macro laws

The double edged sword wielded by the post-survivor knowledge worker: macro laws.

> ... there is very little, and perhaps no difference, between a genuine nugget of self-knowledge and what’s known as a “limiting belief.” A constraint that one minute helps you focus, in the next minute blinds you to an opportunity. A constraint that in one situation saves you from risk, in another situation limits your possibilities. This is why the skill of constantly formulating, discarding, testing, and refining macro-laws may be the most “meta” productivity skill of all.

A [great article](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/06/16/meta-skills-macro-laws-and-the-power-of-constraints/) that essentially says work will always remain essential in the human experience, but once work is no longer being done to survive, the rest is a mind game. 

In fact, I think the most sane view of modern "work" is that it's simply a means for channeling thought, both for producers and consumers. Work occupies a worker's mind, and the product of most knowledge work serves fundamentally to affect consumers' states of mind: services, experiences, etc. 

Work keeps us *busy*—a necessary condition for a sane western mind. No amount of technological progress or economic growth can change this. If anything, the need to stay busy *increases* with technological progress because the [value of our time](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2015/07/08/we-killed-leisure.html) approaches infinity. 

These imaginary problems are extraordinarily difficult to solve.
