<p><a href="http://phandroid.com/2010/06/11/orange-set-to-get-rid-of-unlimited-data-too/#">Android  Phone Fans</a>:
<blockquote>It’s like AT&amp;T spread a very infectious bug across the entire mobile world. Another carrier is set to follow AT&amp;T and O2 UK in scrapping the concept of “unlimited data,” if MobileToday is to be believed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had hoped that the practices of Europe's more progressive mobile industry would eventually spread to the US. But unfortunately, it appears that our UK friends will soon be feeling the effects of AT&amp;T's new tactics.</p>
<p>My question: Is the first world already addicted enough to data for these new pricing structures to hold up, or are the carriers moving too fast? We'll see.</p>
<p>I'm really curious how the UK will react.</p>
