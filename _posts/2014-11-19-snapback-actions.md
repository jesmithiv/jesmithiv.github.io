<p><a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">ScreenFlow</a> gets better with each release. One of my favorite new features in ScreenFlow 5 is the "Snapback Action," which lets you quickly revert your scale and picture position to their previous settings following a video action. I made a short video to illustrate.</p>
