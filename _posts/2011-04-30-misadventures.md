<p>My so-called pre-inbox.txt:</p>
<pre><code>Figure out why dairy cows have spots
Paint interior of crawl space
Research anti-virus programs for my Mac
Install crown molding in attic
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Stop.</strong></p>
<p>Not everything that falls out of your head is worth doing—no more than every tweet in your timeline is worth reading.</p>
<p>I completely agree with David that <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/4/29/automating-omnifocus-task-entry.html">automating batch entry of inbox tasks isn’t worth it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m still adding tasks from a text list manually. I do this because quite often something that seems like a good idea when I peck it into a text file, like perhaps running with scissors, doesn’t pass the sniff test when it comes time to add the tasks to OmniFocus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, this type of automation can come with a cost.  As bitter a cocktail as it may be to the reader base of this blog, Bill Gates really nailed it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let your thoughts flow, and jot them down freely, but apply as much human judgment as possible when deciding <em>what</em> to actually work on.</p>
<p>Pursue the <em>right</em> things. Don’t discount your wetware filter, and don’t let your past self become some idiot boss that gives your future self busy work all day.</p>
