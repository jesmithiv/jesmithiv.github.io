<p>Not sure how I missed <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2014/08/working-with-files-in-alfred.html">this Alfred tip</a> from Gabe in 2014:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can select files in the Finder and double tap âŒ˜ to load them into Alfred, which is ready to act on them instantly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had no idea double tapping the <code>Command</code> key was even a keyboard shortcut option. Done.</p>
