<p> Markdown is about liberation. Liberation from bloated desktop publishing software that&rsquo;s carried far too much baggage forward from the 1990s, a time when the world got drunk on WYSIWYG.</p>
<p>Markdown is almost anti-software. And while my Markdown toolbox is mostly air-filled, there&rsquo;s at least one tool in there I can&rsquo;t work without.</p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marked/id448925439?ls=1&amp;mt=12">Marked 1.4 is out</a>. Thanks for your dedication to the Markdown community, Brett.</p>
