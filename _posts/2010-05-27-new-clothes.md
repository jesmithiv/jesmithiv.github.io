<p>I decided to give the site a makeover. It's a very simple design. My goal is to make this blog as readable as possible. I hope you like the new look. Feel free to let me know either way.Â  I also freshened up the <a href="../about/">About</a> page to give  you a better idea about who I am and my intentions with this blog.
Speaking of readability, do you often find it distracting to read articles and blog posts at site with a lot of adds and flashy stuff around the page? If so, I highly recommend checking out the <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability bookmarklet</a>. A bookmarklet is a special bookmark for your browser than performs an action instead of taking you to a web page. I recommend keeping the Readability bookmarklet in your bookmarks toolbar so that it's always visible and always one click away.</p>
