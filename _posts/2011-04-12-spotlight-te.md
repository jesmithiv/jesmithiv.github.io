<p><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> is like this magical, delicious, calorie-free gravy that can be ladled liberally on almost any textual workflow. “Magical”  because, unlike the stuff that tops turkey, TextExpander makes things even leaner than before.
As a follow-up to my post on <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/03/28/spotlight/">Spotlight search tricks</a>, I wanted to tell you about a really simple TextExpander snippet that I’m using to fetch PDFs super fast.<a id="fnref:f1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f1">1</a></p>
<p>When I type <code>kpdf</code>, it expands to:</p>
<p><code>name: kind:pdf</code></p>
<p>It also puts the cursor right after <code>name:</code>. No matter where I am on my Mac, I can</p>
<ol>
<li>Option-Space to open Spotlight</li>
<li>Type <code>kpdf</code></li>
<li>Type part of the PDF’s name</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s as if all of my PDF files are magically in a single folder. So fast.</p>
<p>If you find yourself doing the same kind of Spotlight searches over and over, I strongly recommend using TextExpander to take care of that recurring text for you.</p>
