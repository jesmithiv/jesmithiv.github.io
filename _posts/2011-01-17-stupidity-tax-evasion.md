<p>David K. Levine <a href="http://www.againstmonopoly.org/index.php?perm=593056000000004233">opines</a> as to why international data roaming charges are so outrageous:
<blockquote>The international roaming market, lacking competition, is dysfunctional: rather than providing a useful service it taxes consumers one-time lack of awareness of prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most US mobile carriers will welcome you home with a four-digit bill if you don’t turn off data roaming or switch to a temporary plan ahead of time.</p>
<p>Thanks to Verizon’s (not so well advertised) international roaming plan, I only paid $8 for roaming when I spent a week in Vancouver last year. Had I used the default roaming rates, my bill would have gone a lot farther north than I did.</p>
<p>Common sense, you say? Well, according to David’s article, 60 percent of international roamers do <em>not</em> turn off roaming.</p>
<p>Joshua Gans calls it the <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/01/charging_the_stupidity_tax.html">stupidity tax</a>. Well it is, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Don’t be stupid.</p>
