<p><a href="http://jamesshelley.net/2013/05/choice/">James Shelley</a> on theatrical theory:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aristotle pointed out that we only know a character’s true character through the choices that they make. If a character delivers a monologue but doesn’t decide or do something, the audience has been given no reason to believe them. Actions alone demonstrate character. . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine if life were more theatrical.</p>
