<p>David Sparks and Brett Terpstra have written a great book called <em>60 Mountain Lion Tips</em>, and I can't recommend it enough. I've already been through the whole book, and my copy is now full of highlights and bookmarks that I can't wait to implement.</p>

<p>"60 tips" is a bit misleading. It's more like 60 <em>topics</em> because virtually every tip topic is accompanied by a concise, but information-rich screencast. Many of the videos are loaded with extra tricks, advice, and demonstrations.</p>

<p>Everyone that reads this book will learn something new about the latest Mac operating system, Mountain Lion. If just one of the tips makes a recurring task easier, then the book, priced only at $7, has already paid you back.</p>
