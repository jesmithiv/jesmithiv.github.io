title: Loving my ScanSnap S1100

<p>I can’t say enough good things about the Fujitsu ScanSnap S1100 mobile scanner.  It’s really the only peripheral I use with my MacBook Pro on a regular basis—other than a French press.</p>
<p>The S1100 has been extremely reliable in the three months I’ve been using it.  And I’ve been using it <em>a lot</em> as a new parent who’s entered a whole new universe of medical and financial record keeping.</p>
<p>The S1100 scans fast, works off USB power only, and is small enough to slip in almost any bag.</p>
<p>If you have an iMac, Mac Pro, or other more stationary setup, you might want to spring for one of Fujitsu’s larger multi-sheet desktop models, but if you use some flavor of MacBook and don’t like to sit in the same place (like me), the USB-powered S1100 is the only choice in my opinion.</p>
<p>By the way, if you’re scanning a lot of sensitive documents like I am, you’ll probably want to keep them in a <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/07/28/create-a-file-vault-on-your-mac-with-secure-disk-images/">secure disk image</a> on your Mac. That’s what I do.</p>
