<p>Eons ago in internet time (a few months ago on the Gregorian calendar), a lot of people got really excited about <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>. Now I'm giving it a spin.</p>

<p>I'm in the middle of an experiment to see if Sublime Text 2 can replace TextMate 1 for the LaTeX work that I do. So far, it's going extremely well. </p>

<p>I just put together a screencast for some folks that I work with, but I since there's bound to be two or three of you out there in RSS land that might be interested, I've made it public (<a href="https://vimeo.com/54484312">watch on Vimeo</a>).</p>

<p>Topics covered:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to install the <a href="https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools">LaTeXTools plugin</a> for Sublime Text 2</li>
<li>Setting up LaTeX projects in Sublime Text 2</li>
<li>Configuring <a href="http://skim-app.sourceforge.net">Skim</a> to sync with Sublime Text 2 so that you can switch from PDF to code at any place in the document</li>
<li>Miscellaneous tips from the perspective of a Sublime Text 2 beginner switching from TextMate</li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, I also highly recommend Jeffrey Way's <a href="https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/">free Sublime Text 2 course</a> if you're hungry for more Sublime Text 2 screencasts.</p>
