<p><strong>Twitter Benefits:</strong> It's an unrivaled source of information and connections with people whose interests are similar to mine.</p>

<p><strong>Twitter Costs:</strong> I look at it all the time.</p>

<p><strong>Net value added:</strong> Negative (probably). While it's impossible to quantify  what I've paid in time and attention lost, I'm highly suspicious that these costs outweigh the benefits of information discovery.</p>

<p><strong>The decision:</strong> I'm deleting all Twitter apps from my iPhone, the device on which I check Twitter most often. The fact that it seemed so crazy to do so makes me even more curious how this experiment will turn out. </p>

<p>I am not ready to quit Twitter entirely. Just ready to evolve how I use it. I'm leaving it on my Mac and iPad(s). For now.</p>
