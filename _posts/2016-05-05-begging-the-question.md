title: Begging the question
---

You should listen to [this episode](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2016/04/22/yanss-074-begging-the-question/) of the *You Are Not So Smart* podcast because it's an episode that you really need to hear. OK, that's actually a terrible reason to listen to it because...

> In this episode, three experts in logic and rationality will explain how circular reasoning leads us to “beg the question” when producing arguments and defending our ideas, beliefs, and behaviors. You will also learn how to identify, defend against, and avoid begging the question, or restating your beliefs without arguing for or against them. 

Yeah, that's a more rational reason. This is the most nuanced, yet most widespread, logical fallacy I've heard in a while.
