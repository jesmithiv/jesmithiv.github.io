<p>I offered <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/10/19/no/">my take</a> on David Sparks’s no journal. David later <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/10/25/the-no-journal.html">followed up</a>, and several other people chimed in, too. <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2011/10/the-not-to-do-list/">Shawn Blanc’s take</a> really hit home for me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… since I began working for myself over six months ago, I’ve found that keeping a No Journal / Not-To-Do List populated is significantly more difficult. The reason, I think, is that now all of my incoming tasks and priorities are self-initiated. They are <em>my own</em> ideas and goals and dreams. Assessing and prioritizing those is much more difficult because I’m already biased to do all of them thanks to the very nature of their origin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now mix in the constant rain of email and other external sources of ambiguous might-be-worth-doing tasks, and this gets at the heart of why modern knowledge work is so difficult.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to do work. Anyone can work. Successful knowledge workers are as good at <em>deciding what to work on</em> as they are working on it.</p>
<p>It’s hard—<em>really</em> f’ing hard—to be a worker, middle manager, and CEO all in one brain. I would be outright lying if I said I was good at. The times I feel most successful at it are the times I force myself to do really high-level strategic reviews—not the kind you can script into a recurring project.</p>
<p>I find that the more often I make time to think about what I'm doing from the perspective of a CEO, the quality of what I do in each “business unit” of my life goes up.</p>
<p> </p>
