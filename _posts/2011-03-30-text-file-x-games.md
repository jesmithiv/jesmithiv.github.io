<p>Believe me. I know.
I know I’m the preacher, and you’re the choir because I’m sure you’re already subscribing to the Mac Power Users podcast. But if for some crazy and unjustifiable reason you’re not, at least go check out the latest episode, “<a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2011/03/mpu-046-workflows-with-merlin-mann-ii/">Workflows with Merlin Mann II</a>.”</p>
<p>Merlin 2.0 is 2.5 hours long. I recommend taking regular breaks and staying hydrated throughout. No operating heavy machinery either.</p>
<p>Merlin gave us the <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/453204090/q-trick">“q" trick</a> in 1.0, and he’s given us an “x" trick this time around. Will we one day look back on this as a low-frequency consonant renaissance of sorts?</p>
<p>And, GoodReader. Good God. You’re going to think about it differently after Merlin 2.0. Apple might, too.</p>
