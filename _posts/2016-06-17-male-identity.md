title: What does it mean to be a man?
---

Avivah Wittenberg-Cox, writing for HBR on ["Rethinking What Masculinity Means at the Office"](https://hbr.org/2016/06/rethinking-what-masculinity-means-at-the-office):

> Women have spent the past century expanding the definition of “feminine” in almost every country on the planet. For the past half-century, the LGBT community has been engaging each other and the world in a conversation about what it means to live outside gender stereotypes. Remarkably, despite these decades-long conversations, for a cis-gender man, the definition of what it means to be a “man” is still quite narrow.

I think we will see much written on this in the next few decades. I think the evolution of male identity is one of the most fascinating sociological shifts taking place right now in the First World.
