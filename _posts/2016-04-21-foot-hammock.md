title: The foot hammock
---

Being somewhat old fashioned, I sit at my desk a lot instead of standing at it. I also have carpet in my office, so I usually don’t wear shoes. The First World problem that this creates is that I tend to put my feet in what are apparently ergonomically disastrous positions without thinking about it.

Experience has shown me that putting unnatural pressure on my feet for extended periods of the day—while not painful at all when I’m doing it—tends to cause my feet to scream at me the next day. As I’ve gotten older, the screaming has gotten louder and lasts longer.

My solution: I bought a [foot hammock](http://www.amazon.com/Accmart-Adjustable-Office-Hammock-Orange/dp/B0169NEPX4), which I highly recommend.
