<p>In my mind, there are a handful of iOS apps that absolutely embody the spirit and purity of Mac productivity. One such app is <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a>.</p>
<p>Simplenote is more than an app, however. It’s a highly reliable, super-fast syncing service that keeps your text notes everywhere you are… as long as you're holding an iPhone, iPad, or Android phone. Wait, what?</p>
<p><strong>Yes, now Android users can access their Simplenote data on their phones using <a href="http://www.solidstategroup.com/solidnote">SolidNote</a>, a simple note-taking app that syncs with Simplenote’s servers.</strong></p>
<p>SolidNote is available in Android Market for only £1.  I have been using SolidNote for about a week. It’s working great for me.</p>
<p>With SolidNote, you can add new notes, edit existing notes, and read all of your Simplenote notes right in the app.</p>
<p>SolidNote may not have quite the elegance factor of the iPhone Simplenote app, but it <em>works</em>. It’s also worth far more than £1.</p>
<p>Bringing Simplenote to Android is mutually beneficial.  Now, I can utilize Android’s great speech to text recognition to compose and edit notes. I actually wrote (spoke) a few paragraphs of a blog draft a few days ago when I had some time to kill. It worked great.</p>
<p>I hope I never get over my amazement of cloud syncing. The fact that I can capture a thought on any device – virtually anywhere in the world at any moment – and have it immediately available on other devices is magical. Absolutely magical.</p>
