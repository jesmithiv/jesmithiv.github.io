<p>Verizon's newest iPhone competitor, the Droid X, will come with an unlimited data plan for $30 per month.
<a href="http://">CNET</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact that Verizon is keeping this data plan is significant because AT&amp;T. . .Â  has eliminated its unlimited plan in lieu of a new two-tiered offer that caps monthly data usage. Now it looks like Verizon is using AT&amp;T's pricing shift as an opportunity to pick off consumers, who may be interested in the iPhone 4 but are scared off by AT&amp;T's change in data plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe this move by Verizon will also stabilize the shift to tiered data plan pricing in the UK, which appeared to be precipitated by <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/06/11/is-unlimited-data-going-extinct/">AT&amp;T's move to tiered pricing</a>.</p>
<p>Will AT&amp;T hold steady or back off?</p>
