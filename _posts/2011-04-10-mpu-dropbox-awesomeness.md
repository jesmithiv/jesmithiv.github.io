<p>Like Dropbox? Who doesn’t, right?</p>
<p>Not too long ago, I was lucky enough to be invited into David and Katie’s Mac Power User studio to talk about my favorite file system in the sky.  Episode 47 is all about <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2011/04/mpu-047-dropbox-awesomeness/">Dropbox Awesomeness</a>.</p>
<p>Riding shotgun with these rockstars through the jet wash of Merlin 2.0 was, in some ways, a daunting task.  But I have a ton of respect for the quality of David and Katie’s shows, and there was no way I was going to miss the chance to be a little part of one. I had a lot of fun.</p>
