<p><a href="/img/temptation.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1518" title="temptation" src="/img/temptation.jpg" alt="" width="265" height="299" /></a>Generally, OS upgrades are welcome news.  The coming OS 4.2 update for iPad has been touted no differently.
4.2 brings major changes, including printing and of course the much-coveted ability to multitask.</p>
<p>From my experience with Android, I know what multitasking means.  It’s essentially a constant invitation to stop what you’re doing and begin doing something else – often.</p>
<p>I was in the group of people that ordered the iPad day one.  But even before my iPad came in the mail, I was somewhat contrarian in my appreciation for the iPad’s <em>inability</em> to multitask.</p>
<p>In March 2010, I linked to a great Computerworld article called <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9170118/The_iPad_paradox_Less_is_more?source=rss_news">The iPad paradox: Less is more</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A strange trend has emerged that violates the more-is-better ethos of American consumer culture. Some products and services are touting limitations as desirable “features.” And consumers are loving it.</p>
<p>This strikes some as Orwellian doublespeak: “War is peace.” “Freedom is slavery.” “Less is more.”</p>
<p>But the truth is that people don’t buy consumer electronics for the quantity of features. They buy it for the quality of experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agreed completely.  I was buying the iPad for the <em>quality</em> of the experience.  And I wanted my core experience to be reading.  I was afraid that if the iPad <em>did</em> multitask, it would detract from my reading experience, and <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/03/14/the-ipad-paradox-less-is-more/">I noted that</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The human mind simply isn’t wired to be able to read an article, chapter of a book, or any other reasonable amount of text while bells, whistles, and sirens are going off around the page.</p></blockquote>
<p>I still feel that way.  In fact, my favorite app on the iPad is the Kindle app, which gives me one white page of text at a time.  Since getting an iPad, I’ve actually been reading books at a faster rate than before. E-books are a win thanks to the iPad + Kindle.</p>
<p>But that was my generation one experience.  Will things be the same after 4.2 arrives?</p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://the99percent.com/articles/6875/first-generation-ipad-the-perfect-hack-for-focus">99% article</a> points out that I’m not the only one wondering:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the months since the iPad’s release, a growing volume of committed users have noted that the power of the [iPad] as a productivity device comes not in spite of the lack of multitasking but as a result of the lack of multitasking. You must use it in a single-minded manner – you have no choice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beginning in November, we <em>will</em> have a choice, constantly.</p>
<p>With any change comes gains and losses.  Multitasking is not all bad.  For example, it will be nice to leave Pandora running while I read RSS feeds or check Twitter.  “Nice” but probably not necessary.</p>
<p>Time will tell if multitasking lowers the overall quality of the iPad experience.  I’m hoping it won’t.  But I’m betting that I will miss the “good ole” one-thing-at-a-time days when all I want to do is get lost in a book.</p>
<p>What do you think about multitasking?</p>
