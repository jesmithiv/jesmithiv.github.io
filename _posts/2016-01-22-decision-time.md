<p>Being highly productive is mostly about making common sense decisions about how to use your time. Secret one is allocating time to making those decisions on a yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, and sometimes twice-or-more-per-day basis. Secret two is not being fooled into thinking decision making is a waste of time. Secret three is being able to realize when past decisions where wrong or when new decisions have to be made as actual events replace expected events. </p>
