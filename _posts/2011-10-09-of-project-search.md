<p>If you</p>
<ol>
<li>use OmniFocus <em>and</em></li>
<li>use LaunchBar or Alfred,</li>
</ol>
<p>Sven Fechner has <a href="http://simplicityisbliss.com/2011/10/09/search-and-open-omnifocus-projects-enhanced-with-alfred-support/">some links</a> you’ll be very interested in.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I’ve avoided adding a lot of AppleScript on top of OmniFocus, but being an incurable search fanboi, I’m really digging project search via LaunchBar.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing these, Sven.</p>
