<blockquote>
<p>The interface is so new that applications will have to be re-written for it from the ground up, just like DOS applications had to be re-written for Windows. These new applications will have interesting qualities. For example, they’ll be written in either HTML5 or JavaScript. They’ll launch full-screen, just like apps on an Apple iPad tablet, but will also optionally run two at a time, side-by-side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, developers. If you have to start over anyway, why not start now with something that exists?</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of not reinventing wheels, especially when I already have <em>really</em> good wheels. I suspect people who sell software for a living feel the same way. But maybe not.</p>
