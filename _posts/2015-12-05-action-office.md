<p>Check out Thomas Borowski's beautifully conditioned and practically-modified <a href="https://thomasborowski.de/2015/12/action-office-rolltop-desk/">Action Office I rolltop desk</a>. So cool. So beautiful to look at. So easy to forget that it was the precursor to the Action Office II, which accidentally sent corporate office design spiralling hellward. </p>

<p>For years, I've been fascinated with sociological factors that lead to the standard workplaceâ€”particularly the cubicle farms that became so prevalent by the end of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The cubicle, which is now in so many ways an icon of misery and corporate servitude in the United States, is an extreme perversion of Robert Propst's 1960s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Office">Action Office II concept</a>. In fairness to Propst, he never intended for the Action Office to turn into the cubicle anymore than Mikhail Kalashnikov intended the AK-47 to become a symbol of terrorism. But sometimes that's how things work out.</p>

<p>By the way, if you're interested in the mid-20th century factors that created the sociological conditions necessary to rationalize the horror of things like cubicles, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Organization-Man-William-Whyte/dp/0812218191"><em>The Organization Man</em></a> by William H. Whyte (1957). It is an exquisitely written masterpiece. </p>

<p>For a more modern and more specific take on the sociology of 20th century office design, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cubed-History-Workplace-Nikil-Saval-ebook/dp/B00FUZQZE0/"><em>Cubed</em></a> is a great and easy-to-read choice. </p>

<p>And probably most entertaining (and deep) of all, read Venkatesh Rao's 2009 masterpiece, <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/"><em>The Gervais Principle</em></a>, for a journey through the personality structures that coalesce around office structures situated on stacks of cubicles. Warning: this one will change you.</p>
