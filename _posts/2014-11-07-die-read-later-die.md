<p>I think Read Later was always a fantasy. The Read Later app genre definitely sustained that fantasy in my mind far longer than it should have.</p>

<p>By waking up from the Read Later dream, I've made more time for reading (usually better) things. If I have time at the end of the day to read, I'd rather spend that time reading text written before Read Later was even a problem that needed solving.</p>

<p>Killing Read Later also means I killed the shittiest of shitty side effects of a Read Later workflowâ€”unread counts. I permanently deleted an entire inbox. I stopped spamming myself. </p>

<p>Today my rule for reading internet text is essentially this: read now or not at all. </p>

<p>In cases where I need to act on a URL later, I use a simple <a href="http://help.omnigroup.com/___">OmniFocus bookmarklet</a> to put it in my OmniFocus inbox along with other things I need to act on. In other words, reading something important is at parity with <em>doing</em> something important.  </p>

<p>URLs that I can't read now and don't need to act on in the near future go into a flat <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> archive. An article that I may need to look at in the future isn't something I <em>need</em> to read later. It's something I <em>may</em> need to read later. It's just a piece of reference material. A simple search returns it on a whim.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong. To waste time is to very much be a human being. I'll never be able to completely clockwork orange myself off of the empty calories dripping out of the "social" web. But I <em>can</em> get better at not putting them in a to-go box. Putting Read Later in the trash is just one way.</p>
