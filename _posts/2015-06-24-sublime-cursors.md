title: How do I love Sublime Text's multiple cursors?

<p>Let me count the ways. Actually, there are way too many reasons to count. I love using multiple cursors in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, especially for writing LaTeX. Just one example: quickly counting columns in a table (or quickly counting anything I've selected).</p>

<p>So without using any brain power at all, I know I have 9 total columns, 8 of which are right-aligned. Make tables all day, and see if this isn't helpful.</p>
