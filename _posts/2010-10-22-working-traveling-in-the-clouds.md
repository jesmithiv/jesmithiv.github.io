<p>Hopefully you haven’t noticed that PE has sorta been on autopilot for the last two weeks.  I’ve been immersed in several projects, one of which just culminated in a trip to New York City to speak at an annual event that my professional organization, the Society of Actuaries, holds annually. That’s right; I’m an actuary by day.
Bear with me.</p>
<p>I won’t bore you with the details of my day job or my recent presentation, which is mostly not relevant to PE. Instead, I thought you might be interested in the tools I used on my trip, or more importantly, <em>how</em> I used them.  Maybe it'll help you the next time you hit the road or hop through the clouds.</p>
<h2 id="theipad">The iPad</h2>
<p>This was the first time I’ve ever attended a conference and not printed <em>anything</em>.  I didn’t even carry a pen with me. Not once was it a problem.  It felt great walking around with only the iPad under my arm.  No fumbling with piles of paper or bulky ring binders. Even better, I didn’t have to worry about getting my paper notes back home for future reference.</p>
<p>There were three iPad apps that I found particularly useful.</p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ithoughtshd-mindmapping/id369020033?mt=8">iThoughtsHD</a> was my main note-taking app.  Mind maps really are a perfect way to take notes when you have no clue where your notes are going but they all revolve around a central concept.  In this case, I used a fairly simple mind map to keep up with things like session notes, people that I met, and other random thoughts-turned-text.</p>
<p>The iOS Calendar app made it easy to keep up with sessions and other important events.</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodreader-for-ipad/id363448914?mt=8">GoodReader</a> to keep my PDF handouts organized.  GoodReader also came in handy while I was giving my presentation.  While I usually avoid reading off of “cue cards,” there are certain things like panelist introductions that I want to make sure I get absolutely right. I created a few PDFs of my notes for quick reference in GoodReader. Worked great.</p>
<p>I probably sold a few iPads for Apple over the course of the week.  Several people approached me and asked how I liked the iPad as a paper substitute.  When I showed them how well GoodReader worked and its annotation abilities, I think they were sold.</p>
<h2 id="themacbookpro">The MacBook Pro</h2>
<p>I love the portability and “instant-on-ness” of my iPad, but I still think my MacBook Pro is critical for any work involving lots of typing – or for working on things like presentations that are still pretty much “read only” on the iPad (as far as I’m concerned).</p>
<p>One of my favorite aspects of Mac OS is not how well it works but how well it <em>sleeps</em>.  I can close the lid anytime and have confidence that my work will be right where I left it – ideal for traveling situations where you typically only get small bursts of time in front of your screen. The ten hour battery life is also huge while traveling.</p>
<h2 id="themifi">The MiFi</h2>
<p>I <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/08/04/shoot-down-the-autopilot-and-pay-as-you-go/">reviewed</a> the Virgin Mobile MiFi earlier this year.  I’m still a fan.</p>
<p>Virgin Mobile currently offers an unlimited data plan for only $40.  Folks, if you travel at all, this is a no-brainer.  The conference room Wi-Fi at my hotel was an absurd $100 per day.  The Wi-Fi in the rooms was $15 per day.</p>
<p>For some reason in the US, the more expensive the hotel, the more á la carte and expensive the internet connectivity.  For a one-time, contract-free cost of $40, you can avoid that whole racket and work on a secure network to boot.</p>
<h2 id="ipadmacbookpromifidropboxtheeverywheretoolset">iPad + MacBook Pro + MiFi + Dropbox = the everywhere tool set</h2>
<p>Together, these four tools gave me everything I needed. I was able to work on the  MacBook Pro, get online using the MiFi, and <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> was my file system in the sky.</p>
<p>Though my devices weren’t physically connected, they were seamlessly bound by Dropbox. I find it very empowering that I can choose any hardware I want on a whim and know that my data will just be there. Dropbox is truly magical, and I can't recommend it enough.</p>
<h2 id="sowhataboutyou">So what about you?</h2>
<p>Tell me about how you get things done on the road or in the air.</p>
<p>Has the iPad changed your mobile workflows?</p>
