<p>David and Katie gave some great advice on writing email in Mac Power Users <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2011/08/mpu-056-mail/">episode 56, “Mail”</a>.</p>
<p>Writing tight, lean emails, especially in a business setting, has become something of an obsession for me.  It’s almost like a game.  I enjoy figuring out how to convey information in as few words and sentences as possible.</p>
<p>I’ve even started using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> link syntax in emails that contain URLs or file paths.  The beauty of Markdown is that it’s intuitive and readable even if it’s never converted to HTML.</p>
<p>Which of these two emails would <em>you</em> rather receive?</p>
