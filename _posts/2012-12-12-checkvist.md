<p>OK, I'm going to stop pinching myself now and just accept that <a href="http://checkvist.com">this thing</a> exists.</p>

<p>Gabe <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/10/checkvist-web-app.html">wrote about Checkvist</a> back in October of this year, and I'm sorry I'm just now checking it out. Usually the phrase "web app" makes me cringe a little, but Checkvist gets web-based outlining right. <em>Really</em> right. </p>
