<p>Though I'm a bit tardy posting this in internet time, it's still well worth reading Andy Kessler's June 11 piece on <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703303904575293021509968904.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_opinion">The iPhone, Net Neutrality and the FCC</a>. It really highlights the importance of having a competitive market for broadband in the US -- and how far we have to go.
<blockquote>Think of real-estate agents or graphics designers or physicians who will incorporate wireless broadband into their business. Usage caps or pricing tiers will be nasty road bumps or even brick walls on the decades-long path of progress and productivity that has driven the U.S. economy since the early 1980s.</p>
<p>I think competition fixes all that. But according to a study a few years ago by Smartmoney.com, less than 1% of 30,000 cable markets had more than one provider in 2000 and 2005. Any guesses for 2010? In Paris and Tokyo, competition is vibrant, with eight to 10 competitors, speeds higher, and prices much lower than in the U.S. More competition here is the way to keep bandwidth charges reasonable.</p></blockquote>
