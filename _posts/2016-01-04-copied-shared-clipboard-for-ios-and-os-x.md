<p><a href="http://copiedapp.com">Copied</a> is really useful if you want a way to copy/paste between an iOS device and your Mac. I heard about it from <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/copied-a-full-featured-clipboard-manager-for-ios-9/">Federico Viticci</a>.</p>

<p>You'll need both the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/copied-copy-paste-everywhere/id1015767349?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/copied/id1026349850?ls=1&amp;mt=12">Mac</a> versions. It syncs through iCloud. If I copy a chunk of text from a PDF, for example, that I'm reading on my iPad, it immediately places that text on my Mac's clipboard. I mean, like, <em>immediately</em>. It's so great. </p>
