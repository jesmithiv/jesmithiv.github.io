<p>If you listened in earnest to the constructive exchange between Merlin and Dan on episodes <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/23">23</a> and <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/24">24</a> of Back to Work and David in <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/7/12/juggling.html">Juggling</a>, it probably means <em>you’re</em> a juggler.
Maybe you like juggling. Or maybe you’re trying to figure out which ball you like holding the most.</p>
<p>Either way, you’ll probably want to read how <a href="http://workawesome.com/career/how-to-quit-your-job/">Cat Stevenson rationalizes being a “slash careerist”</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A decade ago, working two careers might have seemed less than glamorous – but it’s no longer viewed as a second job or a slave-driving way to make ends meet; instead, it’s seen as a well-rounded fulfillment. A smart, secure Plan B. An alternate route to a more promising future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her advice on how to quit the job(s) you like least to focus on those you like more is really good, too. My favorite step is the very first one: start.</p>
<blockquote><p>When we whole-heartedly pursue our interests or participate in activities that foster our growth, the Universe is awesome in its return.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="myadvice">My advice</h2>
<p>As long as you can work on jobs A, B, C, or D and not think about the others, there’s nothing wrong with juggling.</p>
<p>Whether you juggle or not, be absolutely engrossed in what you’re doing <em>right now</em>. Love your moments, and maximize the sum of your moments.</p>
