<p>I was really intrigued when I heard about David Sparks’s “no journal”. <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2011/10/mpu-059-ipad-at-work/">In his words</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time you find yourself having to say no because of how many commitments you have, write it down. I started doing that and looking at the things I was saying no to… and then weighing those against the things I was saying yes to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was his own clever MacSparkian way of staying focused on the creation of his latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118100565/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=practiceffici-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1118100565"><em>iPad at Work</em></a>.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t think I could ever keep up with a no journal because I usually fail at any kind of regimented journaling.</p>
<p>I’ve learned that saying no is extremely important, though. And it only gets more important (and harder) the more successful and productive you become.</p>
<p>The more you accomplish, the more you prove to yourself and the world that you can do anything. And you can… do anything.</p>
<p>But you can’t do <em>everything</em>. No is about <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/10/05/less-and-more/">constructively doing less</a>.</p>
<p>No also gets easier to say once you realize that no is only negative on the surface. Underneath it's powerfully affirmative. Saying no means repeatedly saying <em>yes</em>—to the things you've decided matter more.</p>
<p><em>Yes</em> feels really, really good.</p>
