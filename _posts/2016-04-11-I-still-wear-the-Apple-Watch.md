title: I still wear the Apple Watch
---

In case you haven’t heard, the Apple Watch has now been declared a failure because of at least two categories of shortcomings:

1. It has failed humanity: It has not cured cancer, curbed the incidence of global terrorism, and it has neither confirmed or denied the Big Bang theory
2. It has failed developers: No one can program around the same splash screen: a 60-second spinner

Maybe I’m a Watch apologist, but the Watch’s failures have not made me wear the Watch any less or feel that the roughly $400 I spent on the Watch was wasted.

Considering the frequency with which I’ve used the Watch every day for nearly a year now, the graph of my investment in the Watch per unit of utility is an asymptote teasing zero. For me, all of the following have been *enough* in Watch version 1. 

- **The time on my wrist.** I foolishly let the iPhone replace previous wrist watches. The Watch fixed that.
- **Weather.** The Apple weather complication is always current, forecasts load quickly, and I find the clockface-like weather forecast superior to virtually every iPhone and desktop weather app UI.
- **Next meeting complication.** It’s useful.
- **Activity.** I move more when I know how much I haven’t been moving.
- **Notifications.** I’d rather see most of them on my wrist than have to fish a an ever-growing iPhone device out of my pocket.
- **Hands-free calling.** This was the most unexpected benefit, but the Watch is my preferred way to take calls in private, especially in the car.
- **Easy Siri questions.** “What time is the sportsball game tonight?” or “when is Easter this year?”

I’ve all but abandoned using third-party apps on the Watch, but the breaking of that promise hasn’t made me want to discard everything that *does* work.
