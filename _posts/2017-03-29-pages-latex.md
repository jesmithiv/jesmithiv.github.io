title: LaTeX comes to Pages
---

As you may have heard, [Pages now supports LaTeX][1] equations in both iOS and macOS. Even though it's not nearly as robust as writing and typesetting LaTeX using MacTeX, it's extremely well implemented and will be a huge convenience, especially for one-off files and shorter documents. 

I like how the Equation editor in Pages provides a live preview of the equation as you type it:

As an added bonus, even though Keynote does not have the same direct LaTeX support as Pages, I found that you can copy the equation in Pages as an image and simply paste it into Keynote. The image appears to be a vector graphic because it scales perfectly without any resolution loss.

In a nutshell, this means you can also quickly add equations to Keynote via Pages on the fly.
