<p>I just wanted to textually echo <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/65">Marco Arment&rsquo;s advice to hire an accountant</a>. It fits in well with the &ldquo;do what you&rsquo;re good at so you can pay someone else to do what they&rsquo;re good at&rdquo; message I tried to get across a few RSS entries ago.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2012/02/14/side-economy/">that post</a>, I had a DIY mindset for the longest time. I used to do my own taxes, too. As an actuary, <em>not</em> doing my own taxes made me feel like a painter paying someone else to paint my house. After all, taxes are just based on simple arithmetic and goofy rules for where to plug the numbers.</p>
<p>Fortunately I came to my senses last year.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve started doing more work on the side, and especially since I formalized my extracurricular income-generating activities by starting an LLC, having an accountant on my &ldquo;payroll&rdquo; is now invaluable.</p>
<p><em>Caveat:</em> Understand that hiring an accountant does <em>not</em> mean take your taxes to one of these counter service places (you know the kind). Instead, find someone who really wants to work in your best <em>ongoing</em> interests and who returns your emails and calls throughout the year, not just in April.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ll probably be shocked at just how little a good accountant costs, and you&rsquo;ll probably see an immediate double-digit ROI on what you pay them. My accountant found some really nice (and totally legitimate) home office deductions I hadn&rsquo;t been taking. The tax savings paid for his services many multiples over.</p>
