<p>I'm sure you read Macdrifter every day just like I do. But in the off chance that you don't, here's <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/02/eddie-smiths-writer-workflow/">a link</a> to an interview there with none other than my self-promoting self.</p>
<p>Gabe asked me some questions about my writing workflow. I talk about how I Markdownify my thoughts in nvALT, TextMate, Byword, MarsEdit, and more.</p>
