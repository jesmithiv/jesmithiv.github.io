<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/neil-degrasse-tyson-astrophysicist-charlie-rose-60-minutes/">Fantastic interview</a> by Charlie Rose on 60 Minutes last Sunday. Tyson is perhaps the most passionate champion of science living among us today. If you want to see the full interview, I recommend the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/60-minutes/id403426652?mt=8">60 Minutes iPad app</a>, which is how I usually watch 60 Minutes content by topic. </p>
