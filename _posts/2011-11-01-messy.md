<p>There’s this saying in golf: “There are no pictures on the score card.”</p>
<p>Translated to writing, you might say “They never see your drafts."</p>
<p>In the context of software development, “No one looks at your code."</p>
<p>Pretty processes aren’t a prerequisite to pretty outcomes. Make elegance a virtue of your product, not your path.</p>
