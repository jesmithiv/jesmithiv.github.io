> Unfortunately, this rule — which is the only thing that many people today know about the effects of practice — is wrong in several ways. (It is also correct in one important way, which we will get to shortly.) First, there is nothing special or magical about ten thousand hours.

["People Favor Naturals Over Strivers — Even Though They Say Otherwise"][hbr]:

> Our society is deeply conflicted about the source of excellence. On one hand, we are fascinated with child prodigies, portraying them as wonders of nature. On the other hand, we love a good “overcoming adversity” story, as it inspires us all to greatness.

Jason Fried recently [on Twitter][jf]:

> It’s never been easier to start something. It’s never been harder to keep it going.
