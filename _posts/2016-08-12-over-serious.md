title: Procrastination is for the over-serious
---

"Just start" is the generic advice you usually hear from someone trying to help a procrastinator. Another: "break it into smaller pieces." Seems logical, but not very interesting.

In my personal experience, the best advice is: "make it fun." 

No matter your age, your mind still wants to have a good time. The best products are *by-products* of someone having good timeâ€”enjoying the *process*. So change the setting, spend some money, or just goof-off until something begins to materialize. Why not?
