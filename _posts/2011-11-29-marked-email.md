<p>I get a lot of email from people who use Microsoft Outlook. I don’t know why, but the font size in their emails is smash-your-eyeball-to-the-screen small.</p>
<p>I consider myself to have great near vision, but I can’t read these emails. So I usually select all of the text and paste it into a text editor. That way, I can actually see it.</p>
<p>Before <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marked/id448925439?mt=12">Marked</a>, this post would have ended here. Actually it never would have happened because who the hell cares that I have trouble reading crappy email?</p>
<p>Wait. <em>Marked</em>? Yeah, I said Marked.</p>
<p>Marked not only makes Markdown easier. It makes email easier, too. If you have Marked installed and also have the services that come in the <a href="http://support.markedapp.com/kb/how-to-tips-and-tricks/marked-bonus-pack-scripts-commands-and-bundles">Marked bonus pack</a>, you can</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click a mail message in your inbox</li>
<li>Go to Services &gt; Preview Selection in Marked</li>
</ol>
<p>Bam. You’re now reading the email in Marked. And you can see the text in gorgeously legible Helvetica! Yes sir, the service sends the entire message contents to Marked.</p>
<p>So that this happens even faster, I assigned a keyboard shortcut to the service.</p>
<p>I have no idea if <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> had Mail 5 in mind when he wrote the Marked services, but I was happy to find this odd use of my favorite Markdown previewer.</p>
