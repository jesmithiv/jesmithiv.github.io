<p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9170118/The_iPad_paradox_Less_is_more?source=rss_news">This Computerworld article</a> sums up quite well why I’m looking forward to my new iPad.  I don’t want a device that multitasks so well that my head will spin off as I try to do 20 things at once.
In fact, if the iPad did multitask, I think it would fail as an e-reader.  The human mind simply isn’t wired to be able to read an article, chapter of a book, or any other reasonable amount of text while bells, whistles, and sirens are going off around the page.</p>
<p>The iPad’s success, like other Apple products, will stem from it’s simplicity and quietude. I also hope that it represents a shift back to the single-tasking world. We need to do a better job at focusing on one thing and one thing only.</p>
