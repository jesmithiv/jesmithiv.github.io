<p>Based on the feedback I received, I don’t think many people figured out that the <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/07/27/not-as-i-do/">“couple” I mentioned on Wednesday</a> actually lives in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Our federal government hasn’t set a very good example for us, but at least we have Apple. <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/07/29/the-u-s-treasury-has-less-cash-on-hand-than-apple-inc/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Philip Elmer-DeWitt</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless the debt ceiling is raised by Tuesday Aug. 2, the White House keeps reminding us, the U.S. government will no longer be able to pay its bills.</p>
<p>But the U.S. Treasury is already running low. Its closing balance as of Wednesday, July 27, was $73.768 billion.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, Apple[’s] most recent earning statement shows that it was holding $76.156 billion in cash and marketable securities as of June 25.</p>
<p>Since Apple takes in more money than it spends and the U.S. government does the opposite, the company by now has considerably more cash on hand than Uncle Sam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I honestly do not know if there is a precedent for a private sector company having more cash than the US Treasury, but it’s an impressive fact—for lots of good and sad reasons.</p>
