<p>Looking to re-certify your Mac geek card? If you spend even half the time I've spent playing around with the Loremipscream flavors in <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/textexpander-lipsum-followup-with-ice-cream/">Brett'sÂ TextExpander Lipsum followup</a>, then you're good for a few years.
A practical use for this would be generating random text when designing a web site.</p>
<p>You'll probably laugh your head off at some of the text it spits out. Like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>You don't want hackers to break those places. And here Mummy Bear follows. In the Holiday Inn Lobby! Okay. Trolley.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it's okay to do things just because you can.</p>
