<p>Most parents of young children know how significant an accomplishment it is just to get out of your home in time to be where you need to be—somewhat on time. Leaving with all the objects you need for the day? Well that’s just icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Today my money clip and credit cards didn’t leave the house with me. Fortunately, I averted embarrassment at the first cash register of the day. Since I store credit card numbers in <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-for-iphone/id285897618?mt=8">1Password</a> on my iPhone, all I had to do was hand my iPhone to the cashier, who typed the number in manually.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I could survive this parenthood gig without my iPhone, and apps like 1Password are a big reason why.</p>
