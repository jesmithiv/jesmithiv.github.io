<p><a href="http://www.macdrifter.com">Gabe Weatherhead</a> and <a href="http://chambersdaily.com">Bradley Chambers</a>. . .</p>

<p>Two guys with demanding day jobs. Two guys with families. Two guys that find the time to make amazing things by mixing some spare time with their passions. </p>

<p>Two guys that inspire me to do more.</p>

<p>And two guys with two very different new products. . .</p>

<p>Bradley wrote another book in his <em>Learning to Love</em> series: <em>Learning to Love Google Drive</em> (available in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/learning-to-love-google-drive/id935361379?mt=11">iBookstore</a> and <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/KxaU">outside of it</a>). And thanks to Gabe's new app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tapcellar-beer-finder-check/id895045917?ls=1&amp;mt=8">TapCellar</a>, beer journaling is a thing in my life.</p>

<p>Now join me in drinking and reading to both. Here's to the crazy ones, especially the ones that ship. </p>
