<p>I love writing on a MacBook keyboard. It’s just the right size, and my fingers know all of my text-relevant shortcuts by heart. It’s a touch typing dream. </p>

<p>However, when I’m sitting at my desk working on math-heavy technical documents, I prefer to use the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB110LL/B/apple-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad">full Apple keyboard with number pad</a>. The number pad saves me a lot of time when I’m generating lots of mathematical type.</p>

<p>If the full Apple keyboard simply added a number pad to the layout of the MacBook (or wireless) keyboard, all would be well in my world.</p>

<h2 id="theproblem">The problem</h2>

<p>Unfortunately the full keyboard has an extra <code>control</code> key on the right side, and so my right thumb has to hurdle that key to get to the <code>option</code> and <code>command</code> keys for navigation shortcuts that also involve arrow keys.</p>

<p>On a MacBook keyboard, of course, there is no right <code>control</code> key, and so <code>option</code> and <code>command</code> sit snuggly next to the arrow keys. This feels so, so much natural to me when hopping among words and lines.</p>

<h2 id="thesolution">The solution</h2>

<p><a href="http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/">KeyRemap4MacBook</a> helped me MacBook-ify my full Apple keyboard. Now, my right <code>control</code> key is an <code>option</code> key, and my right <code>option</code> key is a <code>command</code> key thanks to these two settings:</p>

      <img src="/img/remap2-pe.png" alt=""/>
  


  
      <img src="/img/key-remap-pe.png" alt=""/>
  

<p>I decided to leave the default right <code>command</code> key as is. I don’t really mind having two <code>command</code> keys. Plus, it’s nice having a <code>command</code> next to the space bar for my <code>cmd-space</code> LaunchBar shortcut. </p>

<p>Honestly, I’ve never loved the idea of key remapping. It just feels fiddly and wrong to mess with such basic defaults. I think it’s usually far better to adapt your fingers to a keyboard layout. But since I routinely alternate between two layouts and since I lack the ability and interest to build my own perfect keyboard, this was the best solution for me.</p>

<p>KeyRemap4MacBook is a very powerful key remapping tool supported by donations only. If you have similar problems to solve, it’s probably worth checking out.</p>
