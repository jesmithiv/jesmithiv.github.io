[David Hansson][d] on *not* hating modern Apple:

> There’s just something deeply inspiring about seeing what companies, teams, and people can accomplish at the peak of their ability. Especially when it’s happening not just for a single season, but as a reign of excellence.

Post-1997 Apple, Alabama football under Nick Saban, even the US economy post-World War II: non-fans love to make digs at a perennial winner. But I agree with David. It's OK to admire any person or entity that can sustain *peak* success. 

Survival and hunger will naturally motivate any organism. But it's uniquely human to redefine the *possible* just for the sake of it. It's the loneliest of places to work—at the top. But those that do elevate us all.
