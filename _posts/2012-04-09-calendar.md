<p>It&#8217;s a place you should want to visit. It shouldn&#8217;t be feared. Or avoided.</p>
<p>You should love your calendar for simplifying your life by constraining what&#8217;s possible. A calendar is a recurring reminder of how our universe works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Events involving an individual must happen one at a time</li>
<li>Time can&#8217;t be saved; it can only be spent</li>
</ol>
<p>Time is much more like food than money. Time arrives, perishes the moment it&#8217;s ingested, and then gets excreted in the form of memories.</p>
<p>If time is food for memories, a calendar is a buffet of your time. If you don&#8217;t get in line and help yourself constantly, others will help themselvesâ€”to <em>your</em> time. They&#8217;ll be responsible for <em>your</em> memories.</p>
<p>Few task management systems arrange actions spatially such that each action&#8217;s size is proportional to the time required to complete the task. Most calendars, on the other hand, make it easy to &#8220;size&#8221; appointments based on durations.</p>
<p>To fail to schedule work that you, yourself, deem important is to put your wants last in line. You should regularly schedule non-meeting time on your calendar.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s <em>your</em> time after all. Until it isn&#8217;t.</p>
