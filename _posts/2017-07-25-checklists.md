## Intro

I've always felt like the construction of printed math was much more of an art form than regular typesetting. Mathematical symbols are themselves a language, but they are fundamentally a *visual representation* of mathematical knowledge—knowledge that would be much harder to convey through verbal explanations. In other words, equations are a form of data visualization, and the typesetter is an artist attempting to render an abstract form of human knowledge on a two-dimensional surface.

Unlike other graphics, like figures and charts, equations are not that hard to craft my hand with pen, pencil, or chalk. The friction arises when trying to actually to represent those symbols in a pleasing and consistent way on a screen or in print. 

This has never been easy. In the pre-digital era of printing, equation-laden texts were known as "penalty copy" because of the significant additional time and expense it took to set math notation for printing presses. 

Even when modern word processors like Microsoft Word include equation editors, they tend to be difficult to use and often produce unpleasing results. While LaTeX and similar variants produce the highest quality digital math type, these frameworks also have much more of a learning barrier than general word processing. 

But these modern quibbles are much more the fault of [hedonic adaption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill?wprov=sfsi1) than any of the tools available to us today. We have a vastly easier than any previous stage of civilization. 

I think it's critically important for those of us that write math to have at least a basic awareness of the history of mathematical typesetting—a history that lies in the shadow of general typographical history. 

For me, knowing this history has had several practical benefits. It's made me more grateful for the writing tools I have today—tools that I can use to simplify and improve the presentation of quantitative concepts to other actuaries. It's also motivated me to continue to strive for elegance in the presentation of math—something I feel like my profession has largely neglected in the Microsoft Office era of the last twenty years.

Most importantly, it's reminded me just how much of an *art* the presentation of language has always been. Because pre-Internet printing required so many steps, so many different people, so much *physical* craftsmanship, and so much *waiting*, there were more artistic layers between the author's original thoughts and the final arrangement of letters and figures on pages. More *thinking* occurred throughout the entire process. 

To fully appreciate mathematical typography, we have to first appreciate the general history of typography, which is also a history of human civilization. No other artform has impacted our lives more than type. 

 

## The first two internets

While the full history of printing dates back many more centuries, few would disagree that Johannes Gutenberg's printing press fundamentally changed the course of civilization in the 15th century. It was just as much of an Internet-like moment as the invention of the telegraph or the Internet itself.

Before Gutenberg, reading was the realm of elites and scholars. After Gutenberg, book production exploded, and reading became exponentially more practical to the masses. Literacy rates soared. [Reformations happened](http://www.reformation21.org/articles/the-importance-of-the-printing-press-for-the-protestant-reformation-part-two.php).

I would argue that the invention of the printing press was on par with the evolutionary "invention" of human language itself. In *The Origins of Political Order*, Francis Fukuyama explains that spoken language catalyzed the separation of humans from lower forms of primates:

> The development of language not only permits the short-term coordination of action but also opens up the possibility of abstraction and theory, critical cognitive faculties that are unique to human beings. Words can refer to concrete objects as well as to abstract classes of objects (dogs, trees) and to abstractions that refer to invisible forces (Zeus, gravity).

Language also permits practical survival advantages for families and social groups:

> By not stepping on the snake or eating the root that killed your cousin last week, you avoid being subject to the same fate, and you can quickly communicate that rule to your offspring.

Oral communication was not only a survival skill, but a tool of incredible influence. Rhetoric and the art of persuasion were highly valued in Greek and Roman societies.

If spoken language was the first human "Internet," mass printing was the next key milestone in the democratization of human knowledge. Mass production of printed material amplified the human voice by incalculable orders of magnitude beyond oral communication. 


## Of boiling lead and black art

Like all inventors, Johannes Gutenberg didn't really make anything *new* so much as he combined existing materials and technologies in *new ways*. Gutenberg didn't invent printing. He didn't invent the press. He didn't even invent movable type, which typically involves arranging (typesetting) casts of individual letters that can be brushed or dipped in ink and pressed to a page.

![](# "Movable type")

Metal movable type.

Gutenberg's key innovation was really in the *typecasting* process.  Before Gutenberg's time, creating letters out of metal, wood, and even ceramic was extremely time consuming and difficult to do in large quantities. Gutenberg revolutionized hot metal typesetting by coming up with an alloy mostly made of lead that could be melted and poured into a letter mold called a matrix. He also had to [invent an ink](http://www.themorgan.org/collections/works/gutenberg/invention-of-printing) that would stick to lead.

His lead alloy and matrix concepts are really the reasons the name Gutenberg became synonymous with printing. In fact, the lead mixture he devised was so effective, it continued to be used well into the 20th century, and most typecasting devices created after his time continued using a similar matrix case to mold type.

From a workflow perspective, Gutenberg's innovation was to separate *typecasting* from *typesetting*. With more pieces of type available, simply adding more people to the process allowed for more typesetting. With more typeset pages available, printing presses could generate more pages per hour. And more pages, of course, meant more books.

But let's not kid ourselves. Even post-Gutenberg, typesetting a single book was still an extremely tedious process. Gutenberg's first masterpiece, the Gutenberg Bible, was—and still is—considered a remarkable piece of art. It required nearly 300 pieces of individual type. Every upper and lower case instance of every letter and every symbol required its own piece of lead. Not only did each character have to be set individually by hand, justification required manual word spacing line by line. 

Even though Gutenberg's innovations allowed books to be printed faster than ever before, it was an excruciating process by today's one-click standard. But it was within those moments spent arranging characters and lines that the so called "black art" of book printing flourished. Typesetting even a basic text was an intimate, human process as [Clark Coffee](http://haagens.com/oldtype.tpl.html) explains beautifully:

> The Typesetter was solely responsible for the appearance of every page. The wonderful vagaries of hyphenation, particularly in the English language, were entirely in the Typesetter's control (for example, the word "present" as a noun hyphenates differently than the same word as a verb). Every special feature: dropped capitals, hyphenation, accented characters, mathematical formulas and equations, rules, tables, indents, footnotes, running heads, ligatures, etc. depended on the skill and esthetic judgment of the Typesetter.


## A better way to cast hot lead

The art of hand-setting type would be passed down from generation to generation for over 400 years until the Industrial Revolution began replacing human hands with machines in all aspects of life. The most famous of the late 19th century technologies to refine typesetting are Monotype and Linotype, both invented in America. 

The Monotype System was invented by American-born Tolbert Lanston, and Linotype was invented by German immigrant Ottmar Mergenthaler. Both men improved on the system Gutenberg devised centuries earlier, but each added their own take on the art of shaping hot lead into type. 

Because Linotype machines could produce entire fused lines of justified lead type at a time, they became extremely popular for most books, newspapers, and magazines. Just imagine the look on people's faces when they were told they could stack *entire lines* of metal type rather than having to arrange each letter individually first! Linotype machines were extremely popular until they were replaced by phototypesetting and computers in the 1970s.    

The Monotype System produced individual pieces of type. It could not produce the same lines per hour as Linotype, but it maintained the art and flexibility of setting individual pieces of type. 

[Letterpress Commons](https://letterpresscommons.com/monotype/ "Monotype - Letterpress Commons") points out a key computational difference in the two systems:

> In many ways the key innovation in the Monotype System was not the mechanical device, ingenious as it was. To allow the casting of fully justified lines of type, Tolbert Lanston chose not to follow the path of Ottmar Merganthaler, who used tapered spacebands to create word spacing. He instead devised a unit system that assigned each character a value, from five to eighteen, that corresponded to its width. A lower case “i”, or a period would be five units, an uppercase “W” would be eighteen. This allowed the development of the calculating mechanism in the keyboard, which is central to the sophistication of Monotype set matter.

Indeed, Monotype, while slower than Linotype, offered more sophistication and ended up a favorite for mathematical texts and publications containing non-standard characters and symbols. 

The Monotype System is an exquisite piece of engineering, and in many ways represents a perfection of Gutenberg's original workflow using Industrial Age technology. It's also a fantastic example of early "programming" since it made use of hole-punched paper tape to instruct the operations of a machine—an innovation that many people associate with the rise of computing in the mid-20th century, but was in use [as early as 1725](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card).  

Like Gutenberg, Lanston sought to refine the workflow of typesetting by dividing it into specialized sub-steps. The Monotype System consisted of two machines: a giant keyboard and type caster. 

The keyboard had distinct keys for different cases of letters, numbers, and common symbols. The keyboard operator's job was essentially to type letter by letter and make decisions about where to end lines. Once a line was ended, the machine would calculate the word spacing required to justify the line and punch holes into the paper tape. The caster was designed to read the hole patterns to determine how to actually cast the lines. 

Therefore, a print shop could accelerate the "input" phase of typecasting by simply adding more keyboards (and people) to the process. This was a significant improvement over hand setting because a keyboard operator could generate more tape per hour than a human compositor could arrange type by hand. 

The caster machine was also very efficient. As it read the tape line by line, it would inject hot, liquid lead into each type matrix, then output water-cooled type into a galley, where it came out pre-assembled into justified lines.

At this stage, the Monotype System offered a major advantage over Linotype. If a compositor—or just anyone proofing the galley— found an error, the type could be fixed by hand with relative ease (especially if only a single character needed correcting).

It's also easy to see why Monotype was superior to Linotype for technical writing, including mathematics. Even though the Monotype keyboard had tons of keys and could be modified for special purposes, it wasn't designed to generate mathematical notation.

As I said earlier, no matter how hard it's ever been to create text, creating math has always been even harder. [Daniel Rhatigan](http://ultrasparky.org/school/pdf/Rhatigan_Monotype_4-line_math.pdf):

> Despite the efficiency of the standard Monotype system, mechanical composition could only accommodate the most basic mathematical notation. Simple single-line expressions might be set without manual intervention, but most maths call for a mix of roman and italic characters, numerals, Greek symbols, superior and inferior characters, and many other symbols. To ease the process, printers and Monotype itself often urged authors to use alternate forms of notation that could be set more easily, but the clarity of the subject matter often depended on notation that was more difficult to set. Even if there were room in the matrix case for all the symbols needed at one time, the frequent use of oversize characters, strip rules, and stacked characters and symbols require type set on alternate body sizes and fitted together like a puzzle. This wide variety of type styles and sizes made if [sic] costly to set text with even moderately complex mathematics, since so much time and effort went into composing the material by hand at the make-up stage.

While the Monotype System would never fully displace the hand composition of math, UK-based Monotype Corporation made great strides toward this end in the 1950s with a new 4-line system for setting equations. The 4-line system essentially divided the standard equation line into four regions: regions one and two were in the upper half of the line, while regions three and four were in the lower half. It also allowed for a thin, two-point-high strip between the second and third regions. This middle strip was exactly the height of a standard equals sign (=) and was a key feature distinguishing Monotype's 4-line system from the competing "Patton method" for 4-line math equations developed in the U.S. 

While Monotype's 4-line system would standardize mathematical typography more than ever before, allowing for many math symbols to be set using a modified Monotype keyboard, it would prove to be the "last hoorah" for Monotype's role in mathematical typography—and more generally, the era of hot metal type. Roughly a decade after the 4-line system was put into production, the "cold type" era would begin.








 

 







## Speed over art

The 20th century, particularly post-World War II, saw an explosion in scientific literature, not just in academia but in the public and private sector as well. Telecommunications booms and space races don't happen without a lot of math sharing.

Monotype was only a solution for publications worth the cost of sending to a printing press. Many technical papers were "printed" using a typewriter. Equations could either be written in by hand or composed on something like an [IBM Selectric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter) typewriter, which became very popular in the 1960s. Typewriters were office mainstays well into the late 20th century. 

Larger departments at businesses and universities not only had legions of secretarial workers capable of typing papers, but many had technical typists as well. Anecdotes like this one from a Math Overflow commenter, [Peter May](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19930/writing-papers-in-pre-latex-era), highlight the daily struggles that took place:

> At Chicago in the 1960's and 1970's we had a technical typist who got to the point that he, knowing no mathematics, could and did catch mathematical mistakes just from the look of things. He also considered himself an artist, and it was a real battle to get things the way you and not he wanted them.

The Selectric's key feature was a golf ball-sized typeball that could be interchanged. One of the typeballs IBM made [contained math symbols](http://www.duxburysystems.org/downloads/library/texas/apple/cnthesis/selectric.htm), so a typist could simply swap out typeballs as needed to produce a paper containing math notation. However, the printed results [were arguably worse aesthetically than handwritten math](https://nickhigham.wordpress.com/2016/09/26/mathematical-word-processing-historical-snippets/) and not even comparable to Monotype.



## Type goes cold

As the second half of the 20th century progressed, technological progress would make it easier and easier to indulge those who preferred speed to aesthetics. In the 1960s, phototypesetting—which was actually invented right after World War II but had to "wait" on several computer-era innovations to fully come of age—rapidly replaced hot lead and metal matrixes with light and film negatives.

Every aspect of phototypesetting was *dramatically* faster than hot metal type setting. As phototypesetting matured, text could be entered on a screen rather than the traditional keyboarding process required for Monotype and Linotype. This made it much easier to catch errors during the keyboarding process.

Phototypesetters could generate hundreds of characters per second by rapidly flashing light through the film negative matrix. And instead of arranging lead galleys of type, compositors began arranging what were essentially photographs of text.

Phototypesetting also offered more flexibility. With a Monotype or Linotype machine, font sizes were constrained by the physical size of the matrix. Such physical constraints don't apply to light, which could easily be magnified in a phototypesetter to create larger versions of characters. 

Phototypesetting was indeed the new king of typography—but it would prove to simply be a figure head appointed by the burgeoning computer age. As we all know now, anything made possible by computers can be obsoleted by computers. [Clark Coffee](http://haagens.com/oldtype.tpl.html):

> Without a computer to drive them, phototypesetters are just like the old Linotype machines except that they produce paper instead of lead. But, with a computer, all of the old Typesetters' decisions can be programmed. We can kern characters with abandon, dictionaries and programs can make nearly all hyphenations correctly, lines and columns can be justified, and special effects like dropped capitals become routine. 

In the late 1970s, computers had become advanced enough to do such things, but of course computers, themselves, [don't *want* to make art](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2017/06/21/doesnt-want-anything.html). Computers need instructions from artists. Fortunately for all of us, there *was* such an artist with the programming chops and passion to carry the art of typesetting—an art shaped by over five centuries of hand-setting hot lead—into the digital age.

title: A nod to checklists

Gabe whipped up a [great list](http://www.macdrifter.com/2017/07/managing-check-lists.html) of checklist tools. My favorite aspect of his post is that there's no clear winner. There shouldn't be. 

Checklists can come in all forms, and the ideal format depends entirely on the application. For me, checklists make sense when I need to see not only what needs to be done, but also what I've *already done*. Apps that automatically "vanish" completed tasks fail to do the latter. 

For me, sometimes there's just no substitute for a spreadsheet for large checklists, especially if each item can have multiple statuses or dimensions. Sometimes adding more columns is way more efficient than adding more tasks (rows). 

For packing lists, I've tried so many apps, but [OmniOutliner](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner) is the best for me. It's simple checkbox feature is perfect, and I have several templates I use for different types of trips. 

Sometimes an Apple Note will suffice, and sometimes I just "x" lines in [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quickly-capture-notes-share-anywhere/id905337691?mt=8) for a quick and dirty grocery list. 

When I'm working with large numbers of LaTeX files on my Mac, I use file colors, prefix schemes, and even moving files from one folder to another to keep what I've processed and what I haven't. 

Checklists are as old as civilization and are one of the most fundamental ways to augment the human mind, which needs help seeing where it's been and where it needs to go. Everyone can benefit from checklists. Just check out *[The Checklist Manifesto](https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000)*.


## Using math to typeset math

Donald Knuth knew Monotype couldn't be saved, but he wasn't ready to surrender to the aesthetic compromises of phototypesetting. In "Communications of Mathematics with TeX," Barbara Beeton and Richard Palais describe the impetus for one of Knuth's most famous creations:

> Donald Knuth, a professor of computer science at Stanford University, was writing a projected seven-volume survey entitled *The Art of Computer Programming*. Volume 3 was published in 1973, composed with Monotype. By then, computer science had advanced to the point where a revised edition of volume 2 was in order but Monotype composition was no longer possible. The galleys returned to Knuth by his publisher were photocomposed. Knuth was distressed: the results looked so awful that it discouraged him from wanting to write any more. But an opportunity presented itself in the form of the emerging digital output devices—images of letters could be constructed of zeros and ones. This was something that he, as a computer scientist, understood. Thus began the development of TeX.

By 1978, he was ready to announce TeX to the world at the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society (AMS):

> Mathematics books and journals do not look as beautiful as they used to. It is not that their mathematical content is unsatisfactory, rather that the old and well-developed traditions of typesetting have become too expensive. Fortunately, it now appears that mathematics itself can be used to solve this problem. 

In his lecture, subsequently published by AMS in March 1979, Knuth himself acknowledges that he was not the first to engineer letters, numbers, and symbols using mathematical techniques. A number of other people had attempted this as early as the 15 century, but they were constrained by a much simpler mathematical toolbox: mainly lines and circles.

By the 1970s, there were more sophisticated mathematical tools like cubic splines, which made it possible to define formulas for any character shape. These formulas could also be programmed into a computer, and that's exactly what Knuth did to create TeX and its accompanying Metafont system. In doing this, Knuth codified what he felt were the very best artistic practices of obsolete human typesetters.

Of course, all of this still required digital printing to come of age, which it did in the late 1970s. As long as Knuth was satisfied with the quality of digital printing—and he apparently was—TeX's role was clear:

> ...  the new [digital] printing equipment essentially treats each 
> page of a book as a huge matrix of 0's and 1's, with ink to be placed in the positions that are 1 while the 0 positions are to be left blank. It's like the flashcards at a football stadium, although on a much grander scale. The total job of a system like TEX now becomes one of converting an author's manuscript into a gigantic bit matrix. 

From characters molded in hot lead to pixels. 

While developing TeX and Metafont, I'm sure Knuth had several "this *has* to be the future" moments—probably not unlike Steve Jobs standing over the first Apple I prototype in a California garage only a year or two earlier.  Just like other more celebrated Jobsian innovators of the late 20th century, Knuth's creative energy was driven by the future he saw for his innovation:

> Within another ten years or so, I expect that the typical office typewriter will be replaced by a television screen attached to a keyboard and to a small computer. It will be easy to make changes to a manuscript, to replace all occurrences of one phrase by another and so on, and to transmit the manuscript either to the television screen, or to a printing device, or to another computer. Such systems are already in use by most newspapers, and new experimental systems for business offices actually will display the text in a variety of fonts. It won't be long before these machines change the traditional methods of manuscript preparation in universities and technical laboratories.

Despite Knuth's remarkable prescience in the late 1970s, I doubt he could have envisioned the real-time collaboration tools we have today, but he came close:

> Perhaps some day a typesetting language will become standardized to the point where papers can be submitted to the American Mathematical Society from computer to computer via telephone lines. Galley proofs will not be necessary, but referees and/or copy editors could send suggested changes to the author, and he could insert these into the manuscript, again via telephone.

Even for those of us that "write" math, it is now difficult to fully appreciate the gravity of Knuth's innovation. After all, most of us draft and compose entirely in a digital world where computers instantly render text and extremely complex graphics in real time. Most of us have no firsthand experience of the months-long process of pre-digital typesetting that Knuth knew.
