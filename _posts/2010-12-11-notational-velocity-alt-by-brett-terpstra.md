<p>Have we entered a golden era for Notational Velocity development? Well, it’s as golden as I’ve ever seen.
Brett Terpstra just unveiled a <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/code/notational-velocity-alt/">very polished rendition</a> of my favorite little writing app.</p>
<p>Brett’s version merges some of the great features we’ve seen added to Notational Velocity earlier this year like a widescreen layout and HTML preview window.</p>
<p>He’s also added some nice tweaks to the design and feel. I really like the background shading in the note title pane and the View Source option in the HTML preview window.  Great job, Brett!</p>
