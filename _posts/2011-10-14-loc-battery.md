<p>It seems that everyone has gone location crazy with the arrival of iOS 5. And for good reason.</p>
<p>I’m already enjoying the new Reminders app and how it can tell me to take my trash to the road the moment I get home from work. Dave Caolo <a href="http://52tiger.net/location-based-reminders-are-the-best-thing-ever/"><em>really</em> likes it</a>, too (reminders, not my household sanitation).</p>
<p>Even OmniFocus for iPhone now allows location-triggered reminders.<a id="fnref:1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:1">[1]</a></p>
<p>And speaking of the OmniGroup, they’ve helped clear up one of my biggest concerns with using location-aware tasks: how much battery life is that always-there GPS icon costing me?</p>
<p>If you have an iPhone 4 or 4S, <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/blog/entry/wherever_you_go_there_you_are_location_reminders_in_omnifocus">the news is good</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the iPhone 4 (and 4S) include a feature called “region monitoring”, which lets them track the devices’ location via GPS without running down the battery. iPad 2 models with 3G also have this capability. Unfortunately, devices released before then don’t have a low-power way to monitor their location as accurately, so they won’t be able to use this type of reminder in OmniFocus. (The Reminders app included in iOS 5 has the same limitation.)</p>

<p>How dare I doubt Apple.</p>

<p>Never again will any of us have to forecast exactly when we’ll arrive at a specific position in space. Now if I could just find an app that knows when I’m motivated to <em>do</em> a task, too. Sigh. <a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:1"> ↩</a></p>
