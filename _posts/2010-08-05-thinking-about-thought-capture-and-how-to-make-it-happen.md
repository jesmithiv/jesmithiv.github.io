<p>Is your touch screen phone like a piece of thought fly paper?  That’s how I view mine.</p>
<p>Mobile technology has enabled a boom in “thought capture” tools.  Tech blogs are chock full of them.  There are so many great apps and programs that make it easier than ever.</p>
<p>In fact, there are so many tools (and so many bells and whistles framing those tools), it’s easy to get wrapped up in the tools themselves.  Big mistake.</p>
<p>For a thought capture process to be effective, you have to get over the awesomeness of the tools. Just let it go. A carpenter doesn’t sitting around ogling his hammer all day. Your thought capture technology should be viewed in the same utilitarian light.</p>
<p>Thought capture is the very first step of creating anything – whether it’s a novel, a blog post, a task, or simply reference material.</p>
<p>Thought occurs constantly, but if thought <em>capture</em> doesn’t occur, it’s likely that nothing from those ideas will ever happen.</p>
<p>Don’t assume you will be able to recall a great idea later on.  Your mind doesn’t work that way – at least mine doesn’t.  You also never know how long it will be before you can process that idea.  Life happens all the time.</p>
<p>Remember, the more you capture, the more you can create, which shapes your future and the future of others.<br></p>
<h2 id="practicallyefficienttipsforeffectivethoughtcapture">5 practically efficient tips for effective thought capture</h2>
<p><br></p>
<ol><br></p>
<li><strong>Do it.</strong> Sounds simple enough, but good thought capture means creating the habit.  I have a love/hate relationship with the Muse; I need her, but she usually visits at the most inopportune times – while showering, driving, etc.  Don’t let life’s little frictions tear holes in your thought capture net. I actually got out of the shower to write down the idea for this post. Sorry for that thought.</li>
<p><br></p>
<li><strong>Forget style.</strong> I like to make things look good.  It’s a blessing and a curse. Raw thoughts don’t need formatting.  They don’t need correct spelling, punctuation, or anything. They just need to be intact enough to be recognized later.  If you’re doing a good job of thought capture, it should look like the scribblings of a second-grader.</li>
<p><br></p>
<li><strong>Don’t organize.</strong> Thoughts don’t need to immediately go into folders, be tagged, be consolidated with similar thoughts, etc. Just get it down. Worry about organization later.</li>
<p><br></p>
<li><strong>Make a watershed.</strong> Like rain falling in a valley, let your random droplets of consciousness flow from chaos toward order. Funnel ideas to a central location where they can coalesce with others.  Ideally, you have an inbox for thoughts, and even more ideally, it’s not your email inbox.  I think it’s best to have a separate inbox that’s easily and regularly reviewed.</li>
<p><br></p>
<li><strong>Don't journal.</strong> To me, journaling is too essay-like.  It feels like it needs an intro and a story.  It also connotes commitment.  Forget about all that.  Just get ideas down. Tell the story later.</li>
<p><br>

Thought capture isn’t just for writers, artists, and day dreamers.  It’s for everyone.  Whether you’re an accountant or a street dancer, you have ideas. Your thoughts are your best asset regardless of your niche on this planet.  Putting them down regularly allows them to gain momentum and find allies.</p>
<p>In the next post, I’ll discuss the thought capture tools I use.</p>
