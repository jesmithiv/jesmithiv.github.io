<p>If you’re a productivity geek like me, you probably already use more than one web browser.
If not, I highly recommend it (even if you’re aren’t a geek). It may sound very multitaskish to use multiple browsers, but I find that it actually helps me be more productive by keeping certain activities in silos.</p>
<p>Since starting fresh with a new MacBook Pro recently, I’ve moved to Safari as my default browser. And for a while now, I’ve been using Chrome as my secondary browser.</p>
<p>Where’s Firefox, you ask?</p>
<p>Firefox was my default browser of choice for years, but I’ve recently decided that the speed and stability of Safari are worth more than the extensibility of Firefox.</p>
<p>In fact, I began to notice that Firefox extensions were hurting my productivity. They constantly receive updates, which slow down browser launch. And some extensions like StumbleUpon are like having a social media crack dealer sitting on your toolbar 24/7. These have no place on a productivity machine.</p>
<h2 id="howiusechrome">How I use Chrome</h2>
<p>In my opinion, Chrome has supplanted Firefox as the best third-party browser available.  Chrome launches fast as lightnin’ and now has virtually as many extensions as Firefox (if you’re into extensions).</p>
<p>I use Chrome as my communications and task management browser.  I use it exclusively for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gmail, Google Calendar, and other Google services</li>
<li>Remember the Milk tasks</li>
<li>Social media (Twitter, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefitsofmytwo-browserapproach:">Benefits of my two-browser approach:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Google services run great in Chrome.  This should be shocking to no one since Google makes Chrome.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I can stay signed out of Google in Safari, where I do most of my Google searching.  While I do have <a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/topic.py?topic=14148&amp;hl=en">web history</a> turned off for my Google account, I’m still more comfortable knowing that every single Google search I make isn’t attached to my username. (Of course, I’m sure Google already knows more about me than I know about myself, so this is probably being overly paranoid.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have Chrome configured to launch Gmail and Remember the Milk in two separate tabs every time I open Chrome.  For me, this makes Chrome feel like a productivity application.  If I need to check email, set events on my calendar, or manage tasks, they’re always in the same place.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>By keeping email and tasks in a dedicated browser, they don’t get buried in my Safari tabs. I’m also not as tempted to check email while I’m doing research or reading in Safari.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Like email, by doing 99% of my social media things in Chrome, I stay more focused in Safari.  I’m not tempted to check my Twitter timeline, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The only extension (other than 1Password) that I use in Chrome is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/encaiiljifbdbjlphpgpiimidegddhic">Chromed Bird</a>.  It’s really the best “desktop” Twitter app I’ve found.  It gives me a simple, dedicated spot to use Twitter on my MacBook Pro if I want to.  I use my iPad and mobile devices for most of my tweeting these days though. Note: I recommend turning off all the alert settings in Chromed Bird; otherwise, it will peck you to death at inopportune times.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really think dedicating specific web browsers to specific tasks boosts productivity – especially by keeping communication services out of the way in your primary browser.</p>
<h2 id="whataboutyou...">What about you…</h2>
<p>Do you use multiple browsers?  If so, which ones and how? Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>I’d also like to figure out a way to add an “Open in Safari” option for links that I encounter in Chrome. Currently, I accomplish this by right-clicking links in Chrome and copying the link address. Then I paste the link into LaunchBar.</p>
<p>I’m sure this process could be streamlined with a simple Chrome extension. If you have ideas, please share.</p>
