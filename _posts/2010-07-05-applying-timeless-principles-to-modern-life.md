<p>Last week, I wrote a post at my other blog, <a href="http://risk20.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/a-modern-take-on-carnegies-how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/">Risk + 2.0</a>, on how we can apply lessons in Dale Carnegie's <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> to social media. It ended up on WordPress.com's Freshly Pressed list and got an amazing response from within the WordPress.com community.
One of the things I'm most fascinated about regarding modern technology is the way it connects people like never before. But we have to remember the people part first. Treating people with kindness and respect is always a winning strategy, but doing it online sometimes takes a little more effort since modern mediums are less natural.</p>
<p>Dale Carnegie's ideas are just as relevant today as they were in the 1930s.</p>
