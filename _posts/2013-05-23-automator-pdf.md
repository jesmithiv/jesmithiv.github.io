<p>In a typical day, I use Preview and <a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/PDFpenPro/index.html">PDFpenPro</a> multiple times per hour. Since I use Preview more than half the time to simply look at PDFs, I have my Mac set up to open PDFs in Preview by default.</p>

<p>But I need PDFpenPro <em>a lot</em>, too, and I've been sick of going through the cluttered Open With contextual menu with my mouse/trackpad.</p>

<p>So I made a simple OS X service in Automator that opens any PDF I've selected in Finder (or Path Finder) with PDFpenPro 6. The service is triggered by a keyboard shortcut to make it even faster.</p>

<p>Sometimes I forget how much time I can save by spending a few seconds to make simple Automator services.</p>
