<p>Earlier this year, Merlin Mann and a few other folks more progressive than I were creating a buzz around <a href="http://huffduffer.com/">Huffduffer</a>. For whatever reason, I didn’t pay much attention—until now.</p>
<p>Huffduffer is kinda like Instapaper for podcasts. Ever want to listen to a single episode of a show but not subscribe to the show? Yes? Then Huffduffer is for you. It lets you create your own custom podcast feed.</p>
<p>Huffduffer is so easy to set up and use even a non-geek could do it. Srsly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab a free account at <a href="http://huffduffer.com/">huffduffer.com</a></li>
<li>Drag the ‘Huffduff it’ bookmarklet to your browser’s Bookmarks Bar <a id="fnref:1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:1">[1]</a></li>
<li>Subscribe to your custom feed in an app like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacast/id420368235?mt=8">Instacast</a> (my fave)</li>
</ol>
<p>To add podcast episodes, just go to the episode’s web page and click your ‘Huffduff it’ bookmarklet.</p>
<p>As you add episodes, they’ll appear in your custom feed.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>I keep a ‘Send To’ folder on my Bookmarks Bar for things like this—Instapaper, Pinboard, etc. <a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:1"> ↩</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
