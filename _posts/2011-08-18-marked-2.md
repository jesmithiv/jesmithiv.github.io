<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marked/id448925439?ls=1&amp;mt=12">Marked 1.2</a> is live in the Mac App Store. Brett has added a number of <a href="http://markedapp.com/changelog/v1.2.html">new features and some nice polish</a>. If you write anything in Markdown, I’m not sure why you <em>wouldn’t</em> want to pick up this handy little app for $3.</p>
