<p>An update on my planned <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/home/2015/12/23/dimming-twitter">iPhone absence</a> from Twitter:</p>

<ol>
<li>I miss the positivity and information discovery in my feed</li>
<li>I don't miss the negativity</li>
</ol>

<p>No. 2 is winning. I know less about Donald Trump's day-to-day affairs and gun violence than I have in ages. For that, I couldn't be happier.</p>
