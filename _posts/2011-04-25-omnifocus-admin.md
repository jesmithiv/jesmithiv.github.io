<p>I really like David’s use of “Admin” lists, which he mentions in <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2011/04/screencast-omnifocus-ninja-tricks-part-2-of-3/">part two of his fantastic OmniFocus Ninja Tricks screencast series</a>.
I see each of my OmniFocus folders as life compartments—areas of interest. Each folder contains goals (projects) and single action lists (overhead). Admin is a good, concise label for overhead, I think.</p>
<p>Conceptually I like the idea of maximizing goals and minimizing overhead. In other words—and, at times, idealistically—I put priority on <em>forward</em> thinking over <em>reactive</em> thinking.</p>
<p>Segregating overhead from goals is a critical first step. I’m putting Admin lists in each of my folders so that it's clearer how much overhead I have in each of my life compartments.</p>
