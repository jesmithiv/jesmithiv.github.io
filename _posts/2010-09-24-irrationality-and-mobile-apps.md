<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="/img/99centStore-Sign-pe.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1550 aligncenter" title="99centStore Sign-pe" src="/img/99centStore-Sign-pe.png" alt="" width="391" height="308" /></a>Is 99 cents a lot? What about $1.99? Depends who you ask, I guess.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the slide-out keyboard on my Motorola Droid became even more deadweight and stopped working.  I went to a Verizon store to see about getting a replacement.</p>
<p>At the time, I wasn’t sure how I would recover my paid apps, so I asked one of the store reps about it.  He told me he hadn’t a clue. Furthermore, I was the first person he’d ever met in the store that had actually paid for an app. Wow.</p>
<p>Maybe the guy was new.  Maybe he wasn’t.  Maybe I’m an oddball. Okay, I know that last bit is true, but let’s stay on topic.</p>
<p>Stats support the notion that free is preferable. A <a href="http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/study-free-applications-make-81-app-store-downloads/2010-06-23">recent study</a> found that 81 percent of all app downloads in Apple’s App Store are free.</p>
<h2 id="appuserbehavior">App (user) behavior</h2>
<p>There is a funny paradox with paid apps.  People have such an expectation of free that even something that’s slightly not free (99 cents) presents a major rationalization problem.</p>
<p>I think this inebriated logic is brought on by a cocktail of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring">anchoring bias</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion">loss aversion</a>.</p>
<p>People get too hung up on the price tag of an app, no matter how small when making a purchase decision because there are so many free apps out there (<strong>anchoring bias</strong>). The mere existence of a non-zero price tag is an impassable obstacle.</p>
<p>And as soon as a financial cost is imposed on a decision, you have the chance of losing something. <a href="http://loss-aversion.behaviouralfinance.net/">Studies</a> show that the fear of losing something usually outweighs the prospect of a gain (<strong>loss aversion</strong>). Put simply, the fear of losing 99 cents when an app doesn’t work as advertised takes center stage in your mind; the possibility that the app <em>will</em> work faces unfair odds.</p>
<p>What makes this more paradoxical is that (I suspect) many of the same people that cringe at a 99-cent price tag don’t give the same amount of concern to their monthly mobile bill, or more importantly, the <em>total</em> cost of ownership of their mobile device.</p>
<p>For example, an iPhone or Android phone costs about $200 with contract, and let’s just say that most people pay at least $85 per month for service (rough guessing for the sake of illustration).  Over the 24-month contract period, that totals $2,240.</p>
<p>A 99-cent app is about 0.04% of that total cost ownership. Why does 0.04% of the cost generate so much more anguish than the rest?</p>
<p>It’s really a problem of mental inertia, one of the most powerful anti-logic forces in the universe. How powerful? Think about it: the $85 bank draft happens 24 times over the contract period, each time with virtually no mental angst, yet you may stalk a 99-cent app for days as you weigh scenarios in your head.</p>
<p>You’re resigned to spending the $85 in 24 installments, but pulling the trigger on 99 cents requires a standalone, optional decision.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing: Your “app phone,” is worthless without the apps.  Just like a computer is worthless without software, an app phone can’t reach its full potential without great apps.</p>
<h2 id="practicallyefficienttipsforfightinglogicalfallacies">Practically efficient tips for fighting irrationality</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fight anchoring bias</strong> by thinking in terms of value. What are you getting in return for that 99 cents?  If an app solves a problem and makes your life better and more efficient, I’m guessing that it’s worth more than 99 cents.  In some cases, it may be worth a lot more.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fight loss aversion</strong> by not looking at purchase decisions in isolation. Adopt a the mindset of an experimenter.  Accept that some things will fail, and that you <em>will</em> lose money on lemons. But you will never find the winners if you don’t experiment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fight mental inertia</strong> by looking at the “lifetime cost” of decisions. Try very, very hard not to focus on monthly or recurring prices.  Maybe you <em>should</em> allocate more thought to the decision to buy that iPhone. It’s not cheap over a two-year period. Companies advertise services as “only $30 per month” instead of “only $360 per year” for a good reason. One looks a hell of a lot better psychologically.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thebottomlineyourbottomline">The bottom line, your bottom line</h2>
<p>Value is worth paying for. This concept extends well beyond apps. How do you make value-conscious decisions?</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not a psychologist. Rather, I’m someone with an interest in behavioral finance who probably spends way too much time relating it to tech trends.</em></p>
