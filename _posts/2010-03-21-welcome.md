<p>Welcome to my new blog. I decided to move from <a href="http://e-musing.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> to a more comfy spot with my own domain.Â  In very general terms, this blog will be about getting more efficient at  life without overly compromising your life to get there.
I'm looking forward to posting my thoughts on everything from technology to personal finance to general tips on. . . stuff.</p>
<p>The posts that precede this one were imported from my Tumblr blog. There are a couple of scraps of decent information scattered in them, so I thought I'd bring them with me. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a straightforward way to move the comments too.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to give a big shout out and thanks to my buddy Andy (AKA The Digitante), who was extremely helpful in giving me tips on setting up this blog. Andy is an awesome resource on all things tech (and more), and I encourage you to check out his <a href="http://www.thedigitante.com/">blog</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/thedigitante">follow him on Twitter</a>.</p>
