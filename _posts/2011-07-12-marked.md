<p>I'm reasonably certain that Brett Terpstra is made of flesh and blood like you and me. I've seen photos of him with real people. I've bothered him quite a bit via email. I've even chatted with him over Skype.</p>
<p>He looks human. He sounds human. But with increasing regularity, he goes and does things that aren’t within the realm of a mortal Mac user’s abilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marked/id448925439?ls=1&amp;mt=12">Marked.app</a> is the latest bit of demigod-esque Markdown magic to escape from Brett’s workshop. It’s a clever little thing with a simple purpose. It shows you an HTML preview of a Markdown text file—<em>any</em> text file in <em>any</em> editor.</p>
<p>Just drag a text file onto the Marked.app icon, and it starts doing its thing. I was also able to send a Markdown text file to Marked using LaunchBar:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to file</li>
<li>TAB, then launch Marked</li>
</ol>
<p>Or, from Finder:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select file in Finder</li>
<li>Invoke LaunchBar</li>
<li>⌘G, TAB, then launch Marked</li>
</ol>
<p>If you like writing in Markdown, Marked is well worth your hard earned $3. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marked/id448925439?ls=1&amp;mt=12">Get it from the Mac App Store</a>, or learn about other (very cool) features I didn’t even mention at <a href="http://markedapp.com/">markedapp.com</a>, a gorgeous website worth visiting anyway.</p>
