<p>One of the gems I found laying in my Instapaper unread folder this weekend was Caleb McDaniel&#8217;s article on how he&#8217;s using &#8220;<a href="http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/?p=153">Notational Velocity, Simplenote, and Merlin Mann’s QQ Trick as a Replacement for the GTD Application Things</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t be leaving OmniFocus any time soon, but this is truly an ingenious use of Notational Velocity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s say I need to go to the library to pick up a book on hold. I create a note in NV called qq Go to the library to pick up book. Within the note body I might put the name of the book. I would also put an @work hashtag to tell me this is something I need to do at work. If there is a due date for the task, I’ll type due() and put the deadline in those parentheses.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Now, if I want to see all of this week’s tasks, I enter qq @tw in the search bar, and only those tasks are shown. If I want today’s to do list, I search for qq @to and I have a tidy little list of tasks. I can also filter by any other string. If I want to see all tasks to be done at work I search for qq @work because I put that context in the note body of all my work tasks. I can search for qq @work @tw and so on&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a brilliantly free GTD system, you really should check out the whole thing.</p>
<p>It also occurred to me that since each task is a single text file, you could use OS X smart folders as &#8220;perspectives&#8221; that display meaningful groups of tasks (e.g. everything due this week, everything in context &#8220;@work&#8221;, etc.).</p>
