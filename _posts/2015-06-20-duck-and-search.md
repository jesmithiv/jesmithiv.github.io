<p>Like a lot of other people apparently, I'm using DuckDuckGo more and more. It's not so much that I'm boycotting Google over privacy concerns. I just like supporting different business models for doing things. Diversity benefits technology as much as it does biology and society. </p><p>On my Mac, probably nine out of ten searches go through <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>, so switching from Google to DuckDuckGo is as simple as typing <code>duck</code> instead of <code>goo</code> into Alfred, which stocks keywords for both.</p>

<p>On my iPhone, I mostly use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8">Launch Center Pro</a> for quick searches. Adding DuckDuckGo is as simple as making a new action with DuckDuckGo's URL:</p><p><code>http://duckduckgo.com/?q=[prompt]</code></p>
