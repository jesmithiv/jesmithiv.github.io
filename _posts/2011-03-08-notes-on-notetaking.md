<p>David Sparks and Katie Floyd recently released another great Mac Power Users episode: <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2011/02/mpu-044-taking-notes-on-mac-os-x-and-ios/">Taking Notes on Mac OS X and iOS</a>.
We’ve never had so many access points to the cloud.  iPhones, iPads, and other mobile devices are always with us and always on. That doesn't mean they're perfect, though.</p>
<p>Personally, <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/01/27/meetings-and-the-ipad/">I think</a> the iPad is a great notetaking device. But I also agree with Katie that the iPad's greatness becomes a problem in itself: The iPad can be an attention black hole in a meeting. Everybody in the room wants to talk about it and play with it.</p>
<p>It’s just one example of how technology can bring new frictions to the same workflows it improves.</p>
<h2 id="onemississippitwomississippi...">One Mississippi, two Mississippi…</h2>
<p>I’ve decided that if it takes me longer than about two seconds to decide what to take a note on, I’ve probably thought about it too long.</p>
<p>Getting thoughts down should be natural.  There are many times when I don’t have time to get out my iPad to take a note.  And often if I’m using my iPhone to make a call, I don’t like using it take notes either.</p>
<p>Funny thing: since I’ve had my iPhone, I’ve been more apt to take notes on pen and paper.  I know that I can easily photograph the note with the iPhone’s great camera and upload it to Evernote.</p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jotnot-scanner-pro/id307868751?mt=8">JotNot Scanner Pro</a> is also a very handy app for enhancing the quality of photographed text.</p>
<p>More and more, I like sketching out a mind map on paper while I’m on a conference call or in a meeting. When I’m done, I simply photograph it and throw it away.</p>
<p>Touch screen or no touch screen, notetaking priority should remain in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the note down.</li>
<li>Save, sync, and organize the note.</li>
</ol>
<p>Until someone shows me how I can reverse the order of these two steps and retain thoughts, I’m going to keep pen and paper handy.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I'm even more impressed with <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-scan-multipage/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a>. Like JotNot, it enhances photos of text, but Scanner Pro can also handle multi-page documents. Great app.</p>
