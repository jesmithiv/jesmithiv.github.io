<p>I just wanted to make quick mention of a great blog I've had the pleasure of discovering this year: <a href="http://www.creativityist.com/">Creativityist</a>. If you use your Mac for writing, creating things, or just have an affection for efficient workflows, I highly recommend browsing this fantastic blog by John Chandler.</p>
