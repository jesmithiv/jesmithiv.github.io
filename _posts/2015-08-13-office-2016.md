<p>I finally loaded Office 2016 on my Mac. Here are my thoughts.</p>

<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>

<ul>
<li>Significantly more fluid and Mac-like scrolling</li>
<li>Very Windows-y but significantly more pleasing interface than Office 2011—<em>especially</em> on a retina display</li>
<li>Interface, button locations, etc. are more consistent with Windows version of Office</li>
<li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Keyboard-shortcuts-in-Excel-2016-for-Mac-acf5419e-1f87-444d-962f-4e951a658ccd">Built-in keyboard shortcuts</a> are now consistent with the Windows version (e.g. <code>F2</code> will <em>finally</em> edit a cell in Excel and <code>F4</code> will <em>finally</em> put <code>$</code>s in formulas)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>

<ul>
<li>A more stripped down VBA editor makes doing any kind of serious macro editing difficult to impossible. Microsoft now <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2015/07/22/your-top-10-questions-about-office-2016-for-mac-answered/">recommends</a> developing all macros in the Windows version of Office, but they seem to be hinting that a more web-based solution for macro development is coming.</li>
<li>No ability to create custom keyboard shortcuts of any kind (big bummer)</li>
<li>No ability to customize the quick access toolbar (the improved ribbon layout makes this less of a con)</li>
<li>No ability to buy the thing outright (yet)—you can only subscribe for $6.99/month through Office 365. Supposedly a one-time purchase price is coming in September 2015.</li>
<li>Super talkative to Microsoft's servers. I've never seen an application try to hit so many URLs through so many ports via <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/home/2014/7/8/little-snitch">Little Snitch</a>. This seems consistent with Microsoft's apparent <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2968288/microsoft-windows/windows-10-makes-diagnostic-data-collection-compulsory.html">know-everything-the-user-is-doing</a> in Windows 10. Office 2016 is essentially a giant wants-to-be-connected web app that runs locally on your Mac.</li>
<li>Speaking of giant, it really is. Office 2016 consumes over 6 GB of space in my Applications folder, wherease Office 2011 took up a little over 1 GB.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, Office 2016 for Mac feels like a significant visual update, which makes the experience of using it more consistent with other Mac applications—significantly more so than previous versions of Office for Mac. If you aren't a power user of VBA, macros, etc., it's probably a sensible upgrade. If you don't want Office 2016 to be in constant communication with Redmond, install <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/home/2014/7/8/little-snitch">Little Snitch</a>.</p>
