<p>I recently joined Joe Darnell and Joshua Peiffer on their <a href="http://techtonic.fm/7">TechTonic podcast</a> to talk about my work in actuarial web-based education. We also talked about possible futures that might come out of "big data." It was a cocktail of optimism and dystopia, but it finished pretty easy. I enjoyed it. </p>
