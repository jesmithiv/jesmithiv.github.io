<p><a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> rocks. I can&#8217;t say it enough.</p>
<p>Thanks to Brett, I have awesome writing tools like <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/">nvALT</a>, <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a>, and services that I use constantly without even thinking about them. Brett&#8217;s impact on my Mac-based productivity is immeasurably positive. I&#8217;m sure I speak for countless others, too.</p>
<p>Brett even let this site camp out on one of his web servers for a few months while I was searching for a better web host. </p>
<p>Brett&#8217;s genius in web and app development is matched only by his kindness. I&#8217;m happy to know him.</p>
<p>Join me and others today in saying thanks to Mr. Terpstra.</p>
