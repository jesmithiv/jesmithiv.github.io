<p>The Verge has a remarkable <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/17/3655442/restoring-verizon-service-manhattan-hurricane-sandy">multimedia piece</a> on rebuilding "Manhattan's drowned internet" after Hurricane Sandy.</p>

<p>Events like Sandy put a spotlight on how fragile and <em>physical</em> our "internet" is. For a more global perspective on the physicality of the internet, see <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_blum_what_is_the_internet_really.html">Andrew Blum's TED talk</a>, recorded in June 2012.</p>
