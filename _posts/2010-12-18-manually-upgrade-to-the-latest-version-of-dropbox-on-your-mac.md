<p>As you probably know, Dropbox recently graduated to the big 1.0. Now, Dropbox is <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/help/13">supposed to update to newer versions automatically</a>. Mine, however, did not for some reason.
You can see which version of Dropbox you have installed on each of your linked computers in the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/account#manage">My Computers</a> section of your online account. Just point your mouse at the "i" next to each computer.</p>
<p>If you see that you're still on a pre-1.0 version, you can update manually using these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit Dropbox on your Mac</li>
<li>Wait a bit for everything to really quit</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install">latest version</a>.</li>
<li>Install in the usual Mac fashion</li>
</ol>
