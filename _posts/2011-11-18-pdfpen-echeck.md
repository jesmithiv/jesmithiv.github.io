<p>I’m glad Tom Stoeckel read what <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/11/07/echecking/">I had to say</a> about using Hazel and Automator to format checks for online depositing. In his comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I added an interim step where my ScanSnap scans the PDF to a temp folder and then automatically opens it up in PDFPen for me to insert my signature and a “FOR DEPOSIT ONLY…” statement. I then Save-As to my check scans folder and Hazel does the rest…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m now doing exactly the same thing. My bank has pretty strict instructions for e-check endorsement, and my account number must be written on the back of each check.</p>
<p>I added my signature, my wife’s signature, and the other required verbiage to my PDFpen image library using <a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/help/images.html">Smile’s instructions</a>. Now I don’t have to write all that stuff out by hand each time (or look up my account number).</p>
