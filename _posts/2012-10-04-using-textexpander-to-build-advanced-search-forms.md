<p>Though probably used by a very small minority of the population, most search systems accept operators that provide more control over search output. For example, most web search engines accept operators like</p>

<ul>
<li><code>site:www.practicallyefficient.com</code></li>
<li><code>filetype:pdf</code></li>
<li><code>python -snake</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Spotlight in OS X also accepts a <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/03/28/spotlight">staggering array of operators</a> that make it easier to drill through bulging file systems with years of data and multiple file types. Even the search fields in content management systems like <a href="https://support.evernote.com/link/portal/16051/16058/Article/535/Using-Evernote-s-advanced-search-operators">Evernote</a> accept advanced search operators. </p>

<p>It’s great that all these search operators exist, but I have a hard time remembering them because each system usually has its own syntax. And even when I do remember the correct syntax, it can be cumbersome to type it out.</p>

<p>After struggling with this problem for way too long, it finally occurred to me that <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander’s</a> popup fill-in snippets are an ideal way to build advanced search forms that are customized to each search field.</p>

<p>Now, when I want to search for a piece of text <em>only</em> in a file’s name, I don’t have to remember to type <code>intitle:fragment</code> in Evernote but <code>name:fragment</code> in Spotlight. </p>

<p>Here’s what my Evernote snippet looks like:</p>

<p>By invoking this snippet once or several times in succession, I can do advanced searches far more quickly than relying on memory and fingers alone.</p>

<p>In Spotlight, I’m almost always looking for things by file name. Being able to quickly specify the kind of file makes for really accurate results:</p>
