<p>Nearly every post I write here, including this one, passes through Brett Terpstra’s fabulously simple and effective app, Marked.</p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marked/id448925439?ls=1&amp;mt=12">Version 1.3 is now available in the Mac App Store</a>. If you already own Marked, make sure you update. If you don’t own Marked and you write <em>anything</em> in Markdown—from blog posts to documents—you’ll be happy you spent the price of a crappy Starbucks latte on it.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to grab the <a href="http://markedapp.com/extras/">free Marked bonus pack</a> either. All sorts of goodies in there.</p>
