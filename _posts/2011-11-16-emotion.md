<blockquote>
<p>Early in our careers, weâ€™re encouraged to avoid failure, and one way we do that is by building up a set of emotions around failure, emotions we try to avoid, and emotions that we associate with the effort of people who fail. It turns out that this is precisely the opposite of the approach of people who end up succeeding.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/12/15/dont-be-afraid-to-ask-fewer-questions/">so agree</a>.</p>
