<p>At some point, I'm going to write a thorough rundown of how I use <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> in my daily workflows. It's my absolute favorite task management system.Â  I should cut myself off now because I could gush for 100s of words at a time on how much I like Remember the Milk.
For now, I just wanted to point out that the good folks that make Remember the Milk just released an awesome update to their Android app, which I use daily (hourly actually).</p>
<p>This latest update brings some of the iPhone version's polish to Android. Namely, the addition of the auto-complete smart add buttons makes entering tasks even faster than before.</p>
<p><a href="/img/ss_smartaddauto1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-713" title="ss_smartaddauto1" src="/img/ss_smartaddauto1.png" alt="" width="250" height="417" /></a></p>
<p>The auto-complete buttons were a feature I had been in love with in the iPhone version for a while, and I'm very happy to see they're now available in the Android version too.</p>
<p>This update also brought a number of other refinements and fixes to the Android app. Remember the Milk's blog has a <a href="http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2010/07/android-app-update-auto-complete-for-smart-add-smarter-auto-syncing-and-a-whole-bunch-of-little-fixes/">full summary of the changes</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, if you have any RTM tips, tricks, or questions, please let me know. As I said above, I'm planning to do some in-depth outloud thinking on RTM down the road.</p>
