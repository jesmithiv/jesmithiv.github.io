<p><a href="http://blog.agilebits.com/2015/03/23/an-open-letter-to-banks/">From Agile, the maker of 1Password</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the conversation about online security and banking so fresh in everyone’s minds, I thought now would be a great time to send a message out to banks and financial institutions everywhere to encourage them to to take users’ security more seriously. I’m writing this not only as a member of the 1Password team who deals with security issues on a daily basis, but also as a concerned customer who just wants simple and secure access to her data.</p>

<p>The TD Canada Trust tweet that precipitated this is just incredible. </p>
