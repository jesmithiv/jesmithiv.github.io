<p>I completely agree with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ2ndzHKT9I&amp;feature=player_embedded">Chuck Joiner</a> that it’s become inexcusable for companies to require Internet Explorer as the ONLY option for accessing customer service tools online.
It's been twenty years since the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, met the public. <em>Twenty years</em>. <strong>If today, in 2011, your web site only works in one web browser, your customer service model is broken. </strong></p>
<p>This isn’t just another anti-IE rant.  I would say exactly the same thing about companies that only supported, say, Chrome.  But IE-only is especially bad because it means Windows-only, too. At least other browsers are platform-independent.</p>
<p>Support your customers' preferences, or watch them go to a company that will.</p>
