<p>I will be in Chicago next week at the <a href="http://www.soa.org/professional-development/event-calendar/event-detail/annual-mtg/default.aspx">Society of Actuaries Annual Meeting</a>. I’m speaking at a session called Apps for Actuaries. Two other actuaries and I will be talking about how we use smartphone and tablet apps in our careers.
If you’re attending, I hope to see you there. For the other 99.9 percent of you, posting here will be a little lighter than normal for the next week.</p>
