<p>Since it looks like the iPad is likely to find its way down lots of chimneys this December, I thought I would dust off an article I wrote back in June 2010:
<a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/06/04/yes-touch-typing-is-possible-on-the-ipad/">Yes, touch typing is possible on the iPad</a></p>
<p>After nearly eight months of continuous use, I’m still using the iPad without a bluetooth keyboard. Touch typing is not perfect, but it doesn’t need to be. The benefits of being able to carry one object outweigh any loss in words per minute. <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/10/10/markdownmail-for-ipad-is-a-mobile-web-writers-dream-come-true/">A few TextExpander snippets</a> don’t hurt either.</p>
<p>So if you’re asking Santa for an iPad this Christmas, I recommend not asking a bluetooth keyboard too. With a little practice, you may find that you can enjoy the simplicity and portability of large-screen touch computing as I have this year.</p>
<p>If you end up needing the extra peripheral, that's fine, but at least try to start  light. Build as needed.</p>
