<p>David Sparks makes <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/11/30/microsoft-office-and-the-ipad.html">a really good argument</a> for why Microsoft <em>needs</em> to develop iOS versions of Microsoft Office. I agree.</p>
<p>I see several risks Microsoft brings on itself by avoiding iOS development.</p>
<h2 id="thealienationrisk">The alienation risk</h2>
<p>Today, in 2011, many, many Office users are also iPad owners. These people want an easy way to view and make light edits to Office documents on their iPad. (I know because I work in an industry addicted to Microsoft Office.)</p>
<p>By ignoring a platform that so many of its customers are adopting, Microsoft is doing a disservice to its existing customer base.</p>
<h2 id="theithoughtthingswouldneverchangerisk">The ‘I thought things would never change’ risk</h2>
<p>Microsoft Office was an extraordinary success for Microsoft. But it requires a PC (in the most general sense). PC sales are slowing, while mobile hardware sales are skyrocketing.</p>
<p>The iPad is in its own category somewhere between mobile and desktop, but I personally feel like it’s closer to the desktop experience than “phone” experience.</p>
<p>Today, few people see the iPad as a full replacement for the desktop experience—particularly for heavy productivity. I think this will change. The iPad will evolve. It will become more powerful and more capable. And cloud services will become more accessible.</p>
<p>The iPad of tomorrow coupled with the increasing ubiquity and versatility of remote servers will, I think, marginalize the traditional desktop in a way that can only hurt the current rendition of Office, which runs locally on a PC.</p>
<h2>The 'what if Metro flops?' risk</h2>
<p>Just think about the track record of Windows tablets so far. Yeah. Enough said.</p>
<h2 id="theshipwithoutasearisk">The ship without a sea risk</h2>
<p>I think of hardware and software being like seas and ships, respectively. A ship is designed to run on a sea—to explore it. A sea must precede a ship, and it also defines the boundaries within which the ship can sail.</p>
<p>The iPad is like a new sea that’s just been discovered. People want to explore the hell out of it. Because that’s what humankind likes to do with newfound spaces.</p>
<p>Like David said, Microsoft is a software company, a maker of ships. Can Microsoft prosper if its ships only sail in seas of yore? I think we all know the answer.</p>
