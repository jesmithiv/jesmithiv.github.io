<p>My favorite cloud backup tool, Arq, recently got a <a href="http://www.haystacksoftware.com/blog/2011/08/arq-2-is-out/">nice update</a>. Arq 2 does an even better job of compressing and optimizing backups than Arq 1. That means speed, speed, speed.</p>
<p>I really like the new progress bar and the item-level detail you now get during the backup. Arq 2 also now shows “Other Backup Sets”, which are backups you’ve made for other computers. Very, very useful if you switch Macs and want to continue using your previous backup strategy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Arq 2 is a free upgrade for Arq 1 customers. What? You aren’t using Arq yet? At least <a href="http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/">go check it out</a>. It’s like Time Machine in the cloud.</p>

<p>With Arq 1, this required copying a .plist file from the old Mac. No more. <a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:1">↩</a></p>
