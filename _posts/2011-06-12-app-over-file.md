<p>Dr. Drang has some <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/06/the-cyberdog-that-didnt-bark-in-the-night/">great thoughts</a> on Apple’s strategy to vanquish file systems in user interfaces.</p>
<p>Like most “power users,” I tend to think file first and app second, but I completely agree that people who spend more time using computers as opposed to thinking about using computers do the exact opposite.</p>
<p>The fact that most people don’t question the absence of the file system on their app phone might suggest that “app over file” is indeed the natural order.</p>
