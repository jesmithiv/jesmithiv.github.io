<p>As you may have seen <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/01/14/the-next-nvalt-2-dot-2-beta-is-here/">Brett Terpstra announce</a>, the latest nvALT beta is out. I sincerely appreciate all of the work David Halter and Brett have put into nvALT, which remains the starting point for virtually everything I writeâ€”from meeting notes to blog posts to large writing projects.</p>

<p>If you enjoy nvALT as much as me, I strongly encourage you to follow my lead and click the donate button at the bottom of Brett's <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT page</a>.</p>
