<p>More time thinking. Less time <em>overtly</em> doing. That's really the gist of this <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business/21583592-businesspeople-would-be-better-if-they-did-less-and-thought-more-praise-laziness">highly quotable Economist piece</a> on "leaning back" from work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Creative people’s most important resource is their time—particularly big chunks of uninterrupted time—and their biggest enemies are those who try to nibble away at it with e-mails or meetings. Indeed, creative people may be at their most productive when, to the manager’s untutored eye, they appear to be doing nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
