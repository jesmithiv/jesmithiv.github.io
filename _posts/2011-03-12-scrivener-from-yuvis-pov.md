<p>Wouldn't it be awesome to see a quality screencast on Scrivener made by a real writer? <a href="http://yuvizalkow.com/blog/scrivener/">Good news</a>.
Also, I love how he shows the time marker of various sections along the wayâ€”kind of like an index. That's a nice touch that I would like to see in other screencasts.</p>
