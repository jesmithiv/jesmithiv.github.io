<p>David and Katie are <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2015/5/app-camp-for-girls-funding-campaign-and-matching-funds-offer">generously matching donations</a> to one of my favorite causes today: Jean MacDonald's App Camp for Girls. I happily made my donation today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is estimated that only 20% of software engineers are female; that percentage is even lower among mobile app developers.</p>
  
  <p>The same is true of technology classes in schools. There are few opportunities for girls to explore high-tech fields that aren't already dominated by boys. </p>
  
  <p>Apps are rapidly becoming an important part the world's economy and culture. If women are left on the sidelines of this phenomenon, everyone suffers. </p>
