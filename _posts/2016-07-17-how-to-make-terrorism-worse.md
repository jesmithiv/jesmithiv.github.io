title: How to make terrorism worse

Brené Brown, in her book [*Daring Greatly*][1]:

> We live in a world where most people still subscribe to the belief that shame is a good tool for keeping people in line. Not only is this wrong, but it’s dangerous. Shame is highly correlated with addiction, violence, aggression, depression, eating disorders, and bullying. Researchers don’t find shame correlated with positive outcomes at all—there are no data to support that shame is a helpful compass for good behavior. In fact, shame is much more likely to be the cause of destructive and hurtful behaviors than it is to be the solution.

Just in case you were wondering if post-tragedy Twitter dog piles were having any positive social effects. 

Bigger picture, I would say that shame is the single biggest threat to national security and civil liberties that we face today.
