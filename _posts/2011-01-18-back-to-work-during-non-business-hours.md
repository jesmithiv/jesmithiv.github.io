<p>Two of my absolute favorite internet rock stars, Dan Benjamin and Merlin Mann, are now doing a 5by5 show together. It's called <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/1">Back to Work</a>, and I highly recommend <em>not</em> listening if you need to get work done. You won't be able to focus on anything else. Somehow I think that irony was intentional.
Can't wait to listen to where this one goes.</p>
