<em><strong>Update</strong>: After using Priority Inbox for a few weeks, I've discovered that it didn't really add a lot of value to my email workflow. If it helps yours, great. I'm leaving this post up to show what was on my mind when Priority Inbox first debuted.</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In my opinion, Google revolutionized email by bundling conversations in Gmail, and it looks like Google may be about the write the next chapter in email management with <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/priority-inbox.html">priority inbox</a>.</p>
<p>I have been using a system that represents about 50% of the total solution priority inbox looks to provide.</p>
<p>The goal of my system is <a href="http://inboxzero.com/articles/">inbox zero</a>, and my mobile devices are on the front lines in the battle to protect my inbox.</p>
<p>I triage probably 80% of my email with my phone and iPad. When I have a chance to check email, I rarely spend much time on the checking part.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to read everything, I scan. Then I star and archive anything that may need a closer look. Everything else either goes directly into archive or gets deleted on the spot.</p>
<p>When I get back to a full web browser, I open gmail, and all of my starred messages are sitting in a secondary inbox below my main inbox. This extra inbox is made possible by "multiple inboxes," a feature you can activate by going to Settings &gt; Labs.</p>
<p><a href="/img/mutipleinboxes-pe.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1283" title="mutipleinboxes-pe" src="/img/mutipleinboxes-pe.png" alt="" width="356" height="313" /></a>I have my secondary inbox dedicated to showing starred archived email using the query "is:starred".</p>
<p>This segregates “action required” email from unprocessed email in my inbox.</p>
<p>I’ve been using this system for over a year now with very little modification.  It just works really well for me.</p>
<p>Priority inbox looks like it may supplant the need for multiple inboxes, which is fine by me.</p>
<h2 id="thatgrayareabetweenspamandstuffiwant">That gray area between spam and stuff I want</h2>
<p>Sorry if that heading made you throw up a little but, but I promise I'm not talking about food. Thank God.</p>
<p><a href="/img/spam-pe.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1293" title="spam-pe" src="/img/spam-pe.png" alt="" width="171" height="214" /></a>I’m actually talking about the most promising feature in priority inbox: the ability for Gmail to let the cream of your messages rise to the top.</p>
<p>There are so many, many, many emails that I get weekly that aren’t really spam but are very low priority.  Examples include store discounts/coupons, newsletters, and account statement alerts. I archive or delete most of these on the spot, but I can envision a more efficient system where these all go into a low priority pile and get reviewed on a less fequent basis.</p>
<p>Priority inbox will supposedly "learn" which emails are most important to you and put those at the top of your inbox. Lower priority emails will fall to the bottom.</p>
<h2 id="thebiggerpicture">The bigger picture</h2>
<p>Time will tell how well priority inbox works and whether it can be trusted, but the concept is very appealing.  I think it makes sense for Google to continue to refine something they already do really well: email.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that Google announced priority inbox right on the heels of announcing Google Wave's certain death.  Fact: Google Wave was never going to replace email. Email is just too rooted in the workflow psyches of the First World.</p>
<p>But email can get better through refinements and user-specific extensions.  I think that’s what we’re seeing happen now. Email isn't going away; it's going to get smarter.</p>
<p>Are you using priority inbox already?  What do you think about it?</p>
