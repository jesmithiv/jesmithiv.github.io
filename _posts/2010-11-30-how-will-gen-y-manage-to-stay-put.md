<p>A nice companion to <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/11/29/modern-myopia-happiness-and-a-little-sex/">yesterday's post</a> on modern myopia, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/technology/21brain.html?_r=4">this <em>Times</em> article</a> underscores the challenges faced by Gen Y, a cohort raised on distraction.
<blockquote>Researchers say the lure of these technologies, while it affects adults too, is particularly powerful for young people. The risk, they say, is that developing brains can become more easily habituated than adult brains to constantly switching tasks — and less able to sustain attention.</p>
<p>“Their brains are rewarded not for staying on task but for jumping to the next thing.”</p></blockquote>
