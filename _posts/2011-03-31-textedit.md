<p>I’m just sayin’.
Computers have this way of constipating your thoughts because they take away one of the most natural thought laxatives known to man and woman alike.</p>
<p>Computing isn’t conducive to doodling.</p>
<p>But TextEdit can help.  Use it as a scratch pad – a temporary spot to hold numbers, bits of text, thoughts, or anything else that chips off during your productive process.</p>
<p>In its simplest form, TextEdit can be just a little box.  It can be any size and fit next to any other window.  It’s the easiest way to look at two things at once, and it can really accelerate your productivity.</p>
<p>By using TextEdit as holder of temporary bits and bytes, you’re less likely to encumber your mind’s RAM.  And you’re less likely to flip back and forth between windows.</p>
<p>Give it a try.</p>
