<p>David Sparks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just spent several hours playing with iBook Author’s media tools inserting movies, keynote animations, and interactive pictures into my new secret project <em>and it ruined me</em>. There is no turning back. As an author and a reader, I will never look at a static page e-book the same. While for some types of books, like novels, words on a page are fine, for a lot of books the failure to include media just became inexcusable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m now considering outsourcing all of my thinking to David because his <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2012/1/19/reflections-on-apples-education-event.html">entire post</a> sums up my own impressions of Apple’s Education Event.</p>
<p>When I first saw iBooks Author, I went through the usual initial emotional paralysis experienced by any geek as I virtually elbow-checked my way to the front of the Mac App Store line.</p>
<p>But then I started thinking bigger picture. If it succeeds, iBooks Author represents the first layman’s tool for creating a kind of new composite media that’s likely to become a dominant artform this century.</p>
<p>The marketing emphasis with iBooks Author is clearly on textbooks, but more generally, iBooks Author is a tool for blending previously siloed media into a single thing.</p>
<p>The “open” internet today is rich with media, but they mostly stand alone. And e-books are honestly just glorified pictures of their paper ancestors locked behind glass. iBooks Author may change all of that.</p>
<p>Want to quote something someone said on a podcast? Don’t transcribe it—losing tone and inflection. Drop in an audio snippet.</p>
<p>Trying to describe a highly technical workflow or build a software manual? Why not put a screencast on the page instead bloating the book with unnecessary words?</p>
<p>Would pictures and screenshots tell a story better? Embed a gallery.</p>
<p>Books, particularly technical and educational books, are going to get both shorter and richer at the same time. And anyone will be able to make them.</p>
