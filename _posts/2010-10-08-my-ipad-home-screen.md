<p>Today, my iPad home screen was featured at MacSparky. If you want to see me gush about the iPad, <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2010/10/7/home-screens-eddie-smith.html">go check it out</a>.
For me, it's definitely an honor to join the other great folks that have been a part of MacSparky's home screen series. I have a lot of respect for David Sparks. He's a leading authority on a variety of things Macintosh; he co-hosts one of my favorite podcasts, <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com">Mac Power Users</a>, with Katie Floyd; and most recently, he became an author with the announcement of <em><a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2010/9/29/mac-at-work-the-book.html">Mac at Work</a></em>.</p>
<p>If ever there was a Mac workflow personality that walked the talk, it's David Sparks. If you have an affection for Mac productivity, you should be keeping a close eye on him.</p>
