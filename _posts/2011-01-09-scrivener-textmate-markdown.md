<p><a href="http://bechase.com/mac-blog-workflow-scrivener-markdown-textmate/">Chase Reeves</a> and <a href="http://52tiger.net/blogging-with-scrivener-textmate-and-markdown/">Dave Caolo</a> each discuss how they're using these three tools together. Good stuff.
Chase:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve started writing all my notes in markdown because it’s so simple to get used to and can be converted to HTML in a click or two. I highly recommend getting familiar with markdown if your a blogger or digital note taker.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dave:</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . I’ve learned the hard way that composing blog posts in a browser is a bad idea. Unexpected crashes, network outages, etc. can destroy your hard work.</p></blockquote>
