<p>If reveling in the mundane but marvelous details of modern information workflows is wrong, I don’t wanna be right.</p>
<p>It’s so easy to forget how difficult it was to share things like photos just a few short frustrations ago.  Freezing slices of light has been relatively easy for decades, but putting those moments in front of others called for viscous ingredients like stop bath and the US Postal Service.</p>
<p>This past weekend I made my perennial stop at the BMW Pro-Am golf tournament, an annual event in Greenville, SC, the geographic locale I call home.</p>
<p>As I was taking some shots of Rob Morrow (“Fleischman” of Northern Exposure fame), a man standing next to me reached out to hand me a business card.</p>
<p>Turns out, his son was caddying for Rob, and he was wondering if I wouldn’t mind sending him a few shots. He said mom would be happy, too.  (He probably figured I my Nikon DSLR and zoom lens were getting better shots than his Android phone.)</p>
<p>I agreed of course, and after he walked off, I sent a snapshot of his business card to Evernote with my iPhone, then made a quick note in my OmniFocus inbox to send the photos.</p>
<p>Later, back at my Mac, I edited the photos in Aperture 3, exported a few good shots, then zipped them up in a Dropbox public folder, and emailed the link.</p>
<p>The cost of sharing has reached zero, and the effort required is nearly there, too. I don’t know what’s more amazing: the technology or the fact that it <em>really is</em> getting out of the way.</p>
