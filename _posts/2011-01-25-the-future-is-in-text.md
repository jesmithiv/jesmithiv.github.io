<p><a href="http://www.steverubel.com/markdown-is-a-skill-every-modern-communicator">Steven Rubel</a>:
<blockquote>Video and imagery are critical. But, still, nothing on the web flies the way text does. Words power the web. So it’s critical that every communicator know how to succinctly organize, convey and present ideas for the web and mobile so that they build up readers like nutrients do, rather than weigh them down like junk food.</p></blockquote>
<p>I also really agree with Steven that plain text is tops for writing and that Markdown is the way to ship plain text to the web.</p>
<p>Best of all, Markdown “does not lock you into a system.”</p>
<p>That statement in itself says a lot about the power of Markdown. I think it also says something about the personality of those who use it.</p>
<p>Be agile, be focused, and be future-proof.</p>
