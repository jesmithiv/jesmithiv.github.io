<p>In an <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/?p=11" target="_blank">earlier post</a>, I commented on the security hazards associated with using popular web browsers like Microsoft's Internet Explorer. One of the alternative browsers I mentioned was <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a>, a web browser made by Google. Chrome has a lot going for it right now, and security is increasingly moving to the top of the list of reasons why you should try Chrome for yourself.
An annual event called <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9157098/Hackers_at_Pwn2Own_to_compete_for_100K_in_prizes">Pwn2Own</a> draws hackers to compete for cash prizes.  Up to $10,000 is awarded to the first person to hack into the various web browsers put on the chopping block.</p>
<p>After two days of the event, Chrome was the only browser not compromised.  All other browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari were hacked day 1.  Internet Explorer was <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9174101/Hacker_busts_IE8_on_Windows_7_in_2_minutes" target="_blank">hacked in less than 2 minutes</a> on Windows 7, which is the newest and most secure version of Windows available in the market.</p>
<p>In case you're interested in knowing more, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5502835/day-two-no-one-even-attempts-hacking-chrome-at-pwn2own-competition" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a> explains what makes Chrome unique with respect to security:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps the best indicator of Chrome's security is the fact that competitors haven't even attempted to crack Chrome's "sandbox" despite a $10,000 prize. Chrome gives every process started within the browser very limited privileges to get the job done, keeping it essentially in the sandbox, so while it's possible to get in the sandbox, you can't do very much while you're there. It seems like this bodes extremely  well for Chrome's security system, especially compared to its competition. . .</p></blockquote>
<p>You don't need to know what a browser sandbox is. You just need to know that, for now, Chrome does a really good job of keeping the bad guys out of your computer.</p>
