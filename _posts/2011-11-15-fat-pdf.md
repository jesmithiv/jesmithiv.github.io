title: Remove unwanted love handles from PDF in seconds

<p>Almost all of the PDF files that find their way to me were either created from Microsoft Word documents<a id="fnref:1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:1">[1]</a> or scanned from textbook pages. They all have crazy huge margins.</p>
<p>While margins had a practical function in the paper world, they do nothing but waste pixels in digital landscapes, especially on portable screens.<a id="fnref:2" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:2">[2]</a></p>
<p>I usually crop PDF files on my MacBook Air to make better use of my 13" screen. It’s really easy to crop all pages in a PDF file at once in Preview:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individually select pages in the sidebar (or ⌘A for all)</li>
<li>Click the Select Tool button (or ⌘3)</li>
<li>On any page, select the area of the page you want to remain visible</li>
<li>Tools &gt; Crop (⌘K)</li>
</ol>
<p>That works great on a Mac, but I actually prefer reading longer PDF files on my iPad. Good news: I can crop there, too. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodreader-for-ipad/id363448914?mt=8">GoodReader</a> has a really nice cropping tool. Look for the crop icon at the bottom-center of the screen.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="goodreader-crop-pe.png" src="/img/goodreader-crop-pe.png" border="0" alt="Goodreader crop pe" width="571" height="136" /></p>
<p>Tapping the crop button brings up draggable handles that you can use to trim unwanted fat. It applies your selection to the entire file, too.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="goodreader-crop2-pe.png" src="/img/goodreader-crop2-pe.png" border="0" alt="Goodreader crop2 pe" width="579" height="289" /></p>
<p>It may not sound like a big deal, but cropping dramatically increases the readability of PDF files on the iPad—particularly when reading hundreds of PDF pages (as I often do). By focusing the reading area, pages are much easier to see on a 10" screen. They're a lot easier to turn, too, since zooming is less necessary.</p>

<p>Why a 1.25" margin is still the default in Word, I’ll never know. <a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:1"> ↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>In fact, today, I think the only people who benefit from wide margins are pulpwood companies and lazy English 101 students. <a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:2"> ↩</a></p>
