<p>David and Katie asked me to join them on <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2015/03/15/246-workflows-with-eddie-smith/">Mac Power Users</a> to talk about my actuarial workflows. I probably didn't do much to demystify the work of an actuary, but I had fun anyway. More importantly to society, we talked about which Apple Watch we're buying.</p>
