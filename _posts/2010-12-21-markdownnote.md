<p>The good folks over at Coding Robots recently sent me a free copy of their iPad Markdown editor, <a href="http://www.codingrobots.com/markdownnote/">MarkdownNote</a>, to try out. Given my undying affection for all things Markdown, no arm twisting was required.
MarkdownNote is a writing app designed with the Markdown lover in mind. It shows a live preview of HTML and sports a custom keyboard for common Markdown syntax.</p>
<p>For me personally, I see MarkdownNote as a nice accessory to my existing iPad Markdown workflow. I don’t think I will use it as my primary composer, but its ability to sync with Dropbox<a id="fnref:db" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:db">1</a> and copy HTML to the iPad’s clipboard will definitely come in handy.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:db">Currently Dropbox sync is manual only<a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:db"> ↩</a></li>
</ol>
</div>
