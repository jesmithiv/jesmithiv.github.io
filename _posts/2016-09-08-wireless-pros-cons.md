title: Pros and cons of the wireless future
---


## The ear bud status quo

* Cons
    * Persistently tangled ear bud wires
    * Wires catching on things while walking
* Pros
    * No battery life issue
    * Nothing additional to charge
    
    
## The wireless AirPod future

* Cons
    * Another wire on the night stand (another battery to charge)
    * No music when the battery dies
    * Additional pairing step for use with Mac, iPad, etc.
    * Easier to drop and lose
    * More expensive to buy/replace
* Pros
    * Fewer tangled wire issues
    * Only plug in a wire once per day instead of throughout day
    * More practical to use in a car (but why?)
    
**Conclusion:** This is going to take some courage.
