<blockquote>If you simply drag and drop an app from Finder onto 1Password or its Dock icon, a new Software License item will be automatically created with that app’s icon, name, and current version—half the work’s already been done for you! The only thing left is to paste your license for safe keeping and add any other details you want to hang onto.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cool.</p>
