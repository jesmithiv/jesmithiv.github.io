<p>After a couple of weeks of parenting in the books, one thing is clear to me: The iPhone is <em>the</em> most useful <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">device</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">computer</span> inanimate object in my life. A few reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking, editing, and sharing impossibly-good-for-a-phone photos with <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id329670577?mt=8">Camera+</a></li>
<li>Posting photos online to share with friends and family in other states</li>
<li>Shooting HD video and posting straight to YouTube</li>
<li>Tracking questions for my pediatrician in Simplenote</li>
<li>Scanning and retrieving insurance and other reference information in Dropbox and Evernote</li>
<li>Keeping up with “parenting projects,” grocery lists, and errands in OmniFocus</li>
<li>Referencing books in my Kindle library</li>
<li>Playing Angry Birds at 3:30 am as a last resort to keep myself from falling asleep with a baby in my arms<a id="fnref:f1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f1">1</a></li>
<li>Recording key milestones and baby stats in <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/baby-connect-track-log-share/id326574411?mt=8">Baby Connect</a><a id="fnref:f3" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f3">2</a></li>
<li>Recording thoughts and doing light writing when being near a full keyboard for more than 10 minutes is impossible</li>
<li>Sharing photos straight from my iPhone to an Apple TV in a room full of people<a id="fnref:f2" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f2">3</a></li>
<li>A battery that can handle everything I throw at it in a day</li>
</ul>
<p>What? Seriously? People had kids before iPhones? Nah. Really? How?</p>

<p>Am I the first to go on record with a practical use of Angry Birds?<a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:f1"> ↩</a></p>

<p>If you’re the parent of a newborn and you own an iPhone, drop what you’re doing (not your baby) and go get this app right now.<a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:f3"> ↩</a></p>

<li id="fn:f2">
<p>iPhone + Apple TV is truly the 21st-century’s rendition of the coffee table photo album. Technology is truly getting out of the way. Thank you, Apple.<a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:f2"> ↩</a></p>
