<p>Even if your 1Password master password is weak, and even if your 1Password data were to fall into the wrong hands, AgileBits <em>still</em> wants to make life suck for someone trying to crack your keychain.</p>
<p>It’s little things like <a href="http://blog.agile.ws/2011/05/defending-against-crackers-peanut-butter-keeps-dogs-friendly-too/">PBKDF2</a> that make me love 1Password even more:</p>

<p>The idea is to make using automated password guessing tools, such as John the Ripper, impractical. PBKDF2 strengthens what would otherwise the be weakest part of a system, your master password.</p>
