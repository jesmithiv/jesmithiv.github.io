<p>To avoid inbox shock when returning from vacation, a lot of us check email constantly while on vacation. It's a pretty awful way to live if you think about it.</p>

<p>Around the 10:30 mark of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH4HOLwm0X0">his TEDxNashville talk</a>, "My Digital Stamp," Erik Qualman solves this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When your vacation starts, set your email's vacation auto-responder to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for your email. This mailbox is temporarily full. If your email is important please resend it on [Return Date].</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>When you return, select all the emails you received while on vacation.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete.</p></li>
</ol>
