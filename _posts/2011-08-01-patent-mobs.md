<p>There’s an excellent chance that I’m not the first to tell you, but episode 441 of This American Life, “<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/441/when-patents-attack">When Patents Attack</a>,” is a great use of 60 minutes. Fantastic reporting on a <em>very</em> important problem.</p>
<p>I think the technology sector, in particular the software subset of that sector, is <em>the</em> most promising engine for economic growth in the coming decades, but the mafia-like patent troll industry will be a major barrier to entry. Abusive patent hoarding stops innovation in its tracks, scares off would-be-successful entrepreneurs, and causes artificial price inflation through the parasitic bleeding out of existing companies.</p>
<p>It’s not an easy problem to solve because the “trolls” aren’t doing anything illegal.  They’re merely the beneficiaries of a legal system that doesn’t work in an economy that produces products made of knowledge and idea combinations rather than physical matter.</p>
<p>This is coming to a head in the software industry because software, in my opinion, is just a natural extension of an exploding knowledge economy.</p>
<p>Software products are merely the dipolar arrangement of ideas on a magnetic disk. In a very basic sense, all computer programs and apps are composed of only two ideas: the idea of a 1 and the idea of a 0. Great developers create new combinations of these two ideas just like great novelists create new combinations of preexisting words.</p>
<p>Somehow we have to design a system founded on the concession that there are no new ideas, only new <em>knowledge</em> of <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/08/11/creation-through-recombination/">idea combinations</a>. And we need to get better at rewarding the artists that bring these combinations to market, not court.</p>
