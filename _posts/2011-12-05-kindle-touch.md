<p>I like little local hardware stores. I can quickly get in and get back out with the thing I went there for. In a superstore it’s way too easy to get distracted by all the shiny "oh yeah I forgot I need that" things I have to walk past.</p>
<p>Picking up the iPad to read a book is a lot like walking into a superstore. Before I get to the iBooks or Kindle app, I have to juke out Twitter, Mail, RSS apps, and other attention defensive backs.</p>
<p>I'm not saying the iPad fails as an e-reader. Honestly, it revolutionized <em>how</em> I read by being the first e-reader I ever took seriously. I've read at least a dozen books on it in the last two years.</p>
<p>But when it comes to reading longer form content (books), the Kindle Touch has made me realize that the <em>absence</em> of features in an e-reader is a feature itself.</p>
<p>These are my thoughts on the $99 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005890G8Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=practiceffici-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005890G8Y">Kindle Touch (Wi-Fi model)</a> after reading the equivalent of about 500 paper pages on it.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">The form factor</span></p>
<p>The Kindle Touch is feather light. So light that it almost has this child’s-toy-fakeness feel to it.</p>
<p>It’s easy to walk around reading it with one hand (something I’m tend to do with really good books). As you walk, the E Ink display’s hue changes with light in the room—like a real page.</p>
<p>The amount of text served by the Kindle Touch’s screen is just right. I actually prefer it to seeing two pages at a time in a real book.</p>
<h2 id="kindleispatientlikepaper">Kindle is patient, like paper</h2>
<p>A paperback is inherently a mono-tasking device. It can only do one thing: exist in front of you while you turn its pages.</p>
<p>If you put a paperback down for a few minutes, the pages don’t go dark. It will never never <em>ever</em> display unread counts or push alerts. And you’ll never have to ration your use of a paperback: You don’t rely on it for communication, and it’s battery will never die.</p>
<p>The Kindle Touch is much closer to a tree product than iOS. The battery life of any Kindle is so good, they might as well run on oxygen.</p>
<p>There is a long delay before the screen saver comes on. Even if I have to put the Kindle down for a few minutes, when I pick it back up, I don’t feel a sense of urgency to finish the page quickly—something I’ve noticed that I do when reading on an iOS device.</p>
<p>The Kindle patiently waits while I read each page. It’s a subtle nuance, yes. But I like it a lot.</p>
<h2 id="theexternalperception">The external perception</h2>
<p>When someone sees you reading a paperback, they might ask, “what are you reading?” Same for the Kindle. But no one will <em>ever</em> ask you that question if you’re holding an iPhone or iPad in front of your face. They’ll assume you’re on Twitter, reading email, or playing a game.</p>
<p>Do I care that much about what other people think? No, not really. But sometimes it’s interesting—and constructive—to be asked what you’re reading.</p>
<h2 id="thenot-so-goodthewishlist">The not-so-good; the wish list</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Page turns can be jerky.</em> Honestly this isn’t a huge deal to me, but for a guy that’s been using iOS almost daily for about two years, it’s noticeable. It doesn’t bother me at all while reading, but menu navigation can get kinda rocky.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Light, please.</em> I wish Amazon would figure out some way of adding low-power lighting to the Kindle. I’d gladly trade some of the Kindle Touch’s (purported) two-month battery life for the ability to read at night. Fortunately, Whispersync works really well, so I can easily switch to iOS.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Search is weirdly absent at times.</em> The first time I tried to do a text search within a book, I got a message saying that the book wasn’t indexed. I tried another book. Then another. Same, same. I rebooted the Kindle by holding down the home and power buttons simultaneously. It fixed some books, but not all. Like I said, weird. And disappointing. Search is one of my favorite aspects of e-reading, and it works flawlessly in the iOS version of every e-book app I’ve tried.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Ghosting happens.</em> The E Ink screen usually does a decent job of clearing itself after each page turn, but not always. It’s never too distracting, but for a device whose sole purpose is serving crisp text, I’d like to see Amazon polish things here.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>I don’t need to know page locations.</em> There’s no option to get rid of the location information at the bottom of the screen. Yeah, this is nitpicking. But one thing I love about the iOS Kindle app is that it <em>only</em> shows text. To me, there’s no utility in knowing my location on every page of an e-reader. If I really need to know, I can just tap once to see it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Entering text is somewhere between tolerable and frustrating.</em> I like to make notes in books that I read. The Kindle’s screen just isn’t responsive enough to tap out more than a few letters at a time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given that the entry Kindle Touch is one fifth the price of the entry level iPad, I’m willing to forgive a lot of its touch-related design flaws, which are probably things I never would have perceived had I never used iOS.</p>
<p>And I'm not comparing the iPad to the Kindle Touch because I think they're competitors. They're not. If anything, one extends the other. I'm comparing because they're the two e-readers I've used the most.</p>
<p>If you like to read e-books, I think you’ll like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005890G8Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=practiceffici-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005890G8Y">Kindle Touch</a>. As I said, its best feature is its lack of features. Who thought that'd be worth paying for a few years ago?</p>
