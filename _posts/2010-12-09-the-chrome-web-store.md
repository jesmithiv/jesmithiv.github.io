<p>Google recently opened the doors to their new <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome web store</a>. While many complain that most of the "apps" are just glorified bookmarks (they are), I think this is a fascinating preview of a world soon to come.
We're entering a golden era for app development. It's starting with a major teardown of software concepts that have existed for some twenty years now. This old institution is being upended by two Goliaths.</p>
<p>And it's a fascinating duality. In one corner, you have Google, a company who wants the world to run on web-based apps. In the other corner, stands Apple, a company that's all in on native apps.</p>
<p>I don't care who you side with or if you're somewhere between. You win.</p>
<p>Mashable recently noted just howÂ <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/12/08/ipad-influence-web-apps/">iPad-like</a> many web apps are. We've also recently seen how the iPad is <a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/2054932176/reeder-for-mac-public-beta-even-though-it-is">guiding the future of desktop application</a> development. I believe that we're just now beginning to see how profoundly mobile devices and the web will ultimately transform mainstream computing.</p>
<h2>How I'm using the Chrome web store day 1</h2>
<p>For now, the early versions of Chrome web apps allow me to <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/08/the-two-browser-recipe-for-increased-productivity/">leverage Chrome even more as a productivity app</a> by using it to corral specific activities.</p>
<p>Here are a few Chrome web apps I've been particularly impressed with early on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Todo.ly - a task app that shows just how amazing HTML5 can be.</li>
<li>WeatherBug - a gorgeous weather dashboard.</li>
<li>TweetDeck - this web app version makes it clear to me that I'll never need a native Twitter client on my Mac.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find all of these by searching for them by name at the Chrome web store main page.</p>
<p>Let me know which web apps you like.</p>
