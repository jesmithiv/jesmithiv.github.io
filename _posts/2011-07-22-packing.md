<p>It’s a simple, frustrating fact of your hurried, modern life. Despite your best efforts to design and execute a packing list, you’ll still leave items at home—<em>even</em> things that were actually on your list.</p>
<p><strong>Typical scenario: </strong>Take suit to dry cleaner. Check.  Pick suit up Friday. Check. Pack suit. Check.</p>
<p>Put suit in car? Nope.</p>
<p>The problem: “pack suit” <em>really</em> means “get suit out of closet, and hang by front door.” It’s merely the first step of a critical two-step process.  The second step, of course, is putting the suit <em>in the</em> car.</p>
<p>So I’ve tweaked <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/05/06/of-packing/">my OmniFocus packing project</a> by adding a final sub-project called ‘Car’, which requires me check off key items a second time—once I actually see them placed in my car.</p>
