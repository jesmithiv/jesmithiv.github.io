<p>Dick Grote in <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/09/the_myth_of_performance_metric.html">The Myth of Performance Metrics</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insisting that there must be quantifiable metrics can lead us astray in accurately evaluating performance. For example, how would you evaluate the performance of a translator? The obvious, easy, and wrong answer: the number of documents translated. But while that aspect of performance is easily quantified, it ignores what’s genuinely important — the ability to capture nuance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you think about it, that’s what we all are: translators.</p>
