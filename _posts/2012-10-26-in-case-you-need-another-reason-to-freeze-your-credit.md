<p>If you follow me online, you know I'm a big advocate of what I think of as "personal risk management." To me, it means taking as much control (as practical) of your personal information and making value-based decisions that balance data availability and security.</p>

<p>One of the simplest, cheapest, and by far the most <em>preventative</em> methods for avoiding identity theft is a credit freeze. I've talked about it before on <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/06/17/chilling">this site</a>, and I mentioned it recently on Gabe Weatherhead's <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2012/9/22/002-preparing-for-the-worst-case-scenario.html">Generational podcast</a>.</p>

<p>If your credit file is frozen, your social security number is useless to someone who tries to use it to apply for <em>any</em> product that requires a credit check (loans, auto insurance, credit cards, you name it).</p>

<p>Overly paranoid?</p>

<p>Not really. Take, for example, today's breaking news about an <a href="http://www.digtriad.com/news/national/article/251534/175/Hackers-Get-Personal-Info-From-Dept-of-Revenue-Site">epic hack</a> of the South Carolina Department of Revenue's database:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The extent of the breach was massive: an estimated 3.6 million Social Security numbers and 387,000 credit and debit card numbers were exposed. . . For perspective, there are almost 4.7 million South Carolinians, according to the 2012 U.S. Census, meaning three out of four people's Social Security numbers were compromised.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should assume that at some point your in lifetime your social security number will be used against you. And until the very broken, antiquated, pro-Wall-Street, anti-consumer credit system in the U.S. is fixed, a credit freeze is your best friend.</p>
