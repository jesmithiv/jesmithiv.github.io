<p>Just with your phone, I mean.
Today, I installed a mobile theme forÂ Practically Efficient (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wptouch/">WPtouch</a>). If you visit PE on your one-handed mobile device (i.e. not the iPad), you should see a mobile-optimized version. I know that lots of you read me on your mobile devices, so this may make your life a tad easier.</p>
<p>This is kind of experimental. There are a few things about the mobile theme I'm not exactly in love with, so I reserve the right to yank it back out. If you find any bugginess or annoyances, or if you're just madly in love with it, lemme know.</p>
