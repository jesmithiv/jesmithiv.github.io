<p>I was honored to join my friend, Gabe, on the <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2012/9/22/002-preparing-for-the-worst-case-scenario.html">second episode of his fantastic new podcast, Generational</a>. We talked about data security, personal risk management in the 21st century, and how to make sure your family can access important passwords and documents if something happens to you.</p>
