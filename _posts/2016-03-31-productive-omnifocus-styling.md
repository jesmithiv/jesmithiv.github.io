In case you didn't hear, [OmniFocus 2.5][1] *finally* brings back custom styling. Overall, I've been happy with the general OmniFocus 2 UI design choices. Except for one major fault: the default task note text color is miserably hard to read. I spent about five minutes fixing this with the [OmniFocusColors app][2], and I'm not looking back.

For me, task notes are super importantâ€”as important if not more than the task itself. I want to notice them and use them.
