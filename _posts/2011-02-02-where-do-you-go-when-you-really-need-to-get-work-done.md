<p>Not the office according to Jason Fried of 37signals.
<blockquote>People go to work and they’re basically trading in their work day for a series of work moments. That’s what happens at the office. You don’t have a work day anymore. You have work moments. It’s like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart. You walk in, and you’re day is shredded to bits. 15 minutes here; 30 minutes there. And then something else happens… then something else… and before you know it, it’s 5 pm. And you look back on your day and you realize you didn’t get anything done.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was a great TED talk filled with lots of other quotable statements.  <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work.html">Check it out</a>.</p>
