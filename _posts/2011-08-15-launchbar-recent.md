<p>I’ve been using LaunchBar for well over a year now, but I keep finding new things that make me excited about it. Like what?</p>
<p>Well, like <code>Recent Items</code>.</p>
<p>After invoking LaunchBar, start typing <code>recent</code> to bring up <code>Recent Items</code>, then right arrow to go to files, folders, and apps you’ve been in (recently).</p>
<p>Simple, but oh so powerful. The beauty of <code>Recent Items</code> is that it functions as a folder itself.  Once inside <code>Recent Items</code>, you can just start typing part of a file name to filter the list further. You can even enter folders and move/copy things to folders.</p>
<p>It’s also a great companion to item 3 in my <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/07/28/launchbar-email/">list of methods</a> for using LaunchBar to send email attachments. If you remember working on a file earlier in the day, you can bet it's in <code>Recent Items</code>. There's no telling how many keystrokes it's saved me since I found it.</p>
