<p>Back on <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/07/12/1l-mailplane/#comment-2070">one-liner #9</a>, reader Bruce asked for the fastest way to email a file using LaunchBar.  There are several ways I use LaunchBar when emailing attachments.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate to file in LaunchBar, TAB, then type the name of your default mail application.  I’ve used this successfully with Mail, Sparrow, and Mailplane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A slight variation on (1) if you happen to be in Finder: Select file(s), invoke LaunchBar, ⌘G to send selection to LaunchBar, TAB, then type the name of your default mail application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Least known, probably.) If you’ve already started an email, you can quickly add attachments using LaunchBar, and believe it or not, your mouse. Invoke LaunchBar, navigate to the folder containing your file(s), then drag file(s) one at a time onto your Mail application using your mouse or trackpad.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I use (3) quite a bit because I often realize mid-email that a screen shot, for example, would supplement my message. It’s very handy because the LaunchBar file browser sits atop the email application (no window switching required).</p>
<p>If you have other creative ways of performing email tasks with LaunchBar, by all means pour your heart out here. . .</p>
