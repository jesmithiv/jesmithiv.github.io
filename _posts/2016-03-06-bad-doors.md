  <p>There's a door on the 10th floor of the Vox Media office I hate so much. I can never remember which way it opens, and I get it wrong every single time. You probably know one of these terror doors too. But it's not our fault.</p>

<p>God, I hate those doors. But I'm glad Vox hated them enough to talk about them with Don Norman in <a href="http://youtu.be/yY96hTb8WgI">this video</a>. </p>
