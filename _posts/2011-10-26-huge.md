<p>Brett Kelly has a huge one in his pants. I mean <em>big</em>. Thick and leathery, too.</p>
<p>His wallet is enormous, and he has some <a href="http://nerdgap.com/where-hell-my-wallet-hack/">solid tips</a> for recovering information in a lost wallet using—wait for it—Evernote.</p>
<p>I stopped carrying a foldable filing cabinet several years ago. Aside from no longer viewing the world at a 10-degree pitch or looking like I walked out in the middle of a Brazilian butt lift, not carrying a big wallet has the added benefit of never <em>losing</em> a big wallet.</p>
<p>Instead, I carry just a few things in a money clip:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 credit cards (one for dining rewards; one for everything else)</li>
<li>an ATM card</li>
<li>my driver’s license</li>
<li>some cash</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it. Sure I still need the stuff I used to carry, but it’s 2011. I have <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://www.simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a>, and <a href="https://agilebits.com/products/1password">1Password</a> now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Evernote holds my insurance cards and miscellaneous scans of other things</li>
<li>1Password <em>securely</em> holds additional credit card numbers, my flexible spending account, etc.</li>
<li>Simplenote has my plain text notes—the kinda stuff I might’ve written on a cocktail napkin in the pre-smartphone world.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about those pesky customer loyalty cards, you ask? I usually just give the cashier my home phone number, which is tied to my card.<a id="fnref:f1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f1">1</a></p>

<p>I use my landline number like a throw-away  junk e-mail address. I never answer it; I just let Google Voice keep up with voice messages for me. People that <em>really</em> need me have my mobile number.<a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:f1"> ↩</a></p>
