<p>It's been brought to my attention that the footnotes in my posts don't show up in Instapaper. My footnotes are just plain vanilla HTML created from MultiMarkdownâ€”i.e. no fancy plugins.</p>
<p>If you have any ideas for making footnotes appear in Instapaper, give me a shout. I know a lot of you use Instapaper heavily (as do I).</p>
