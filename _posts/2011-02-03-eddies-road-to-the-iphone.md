<p>If I had a photo of me running with a torch, I would have put it at the top of this post. Alas, I do not.
I know lots of you already have iPhones, and you might be shocked, if  not stung with a sense of betrayal, to learn that I don't. I won't go  into why now. I've already done that in an <a href="../2010/07/01/my-relationship-and-history-with-mobile-technology-and-the-iphone/">epic and melodramatic fashion</a>.</p>
<p>But times, they are changing. This morning, I pre-ordered my iPhone 4—a privilege granted me by Verizon, a company I've dutifully pledged part of my paycheck to for years now.</p>
<p>I was hopeful that the Verizon iPhone wouldn't see the same side of  humanity that all but required a martial law declaration in the cyber  streets leading to AT&amp;T's servers in June 2010.  Fortunately, this  chapter of the iPhone's storied history seems more civil.</p>
<p>But we all know that drama shadows the iPhone, and today I found myself standing right in the middle of it.</p>
<h2>So, about today</h2>
<p>First, I went to Verizon's website. In just a couple of clicks, I began the order process. The experience was clean and easy to follow. There were hardly any fields to fill in. In fact, that was problem: there were too few.</p>
<p>After filling out my shipping address, which was different than my billing address, I saw a glaring error at the top of the page: It told me that I had to enter a company name to continue.  Problem: there was no company name field on the page.<a href="http://community.vzw.com/t5/iPhone-4/Shipping-address-invalid/td-p/403848"> I was not alone</a>.</p>
<p>I was doing all this in Safari, so I figured no worries; I'll just try a different browser. Same problem in Chrome. Okay then, Firefox. Same problem. [tap, tap, tap]</p>
<p>Now I don't know about you, but something felt really perverse, even nauseating, about the idea of booting up a PC to try this in Internet Explorer. I was almost more afraid of it working in IE than not. So, sit back down: I didn't do it.</p>
<p>After reading a few message boards, I realized that I could do this through Apple. Why didn't I think of that? Apple will get it right, right?</p>
<p>When I went to apple.com, I again found myself in a clean, calm interface for ordering my iPhone. I just needed to enter my mobile number, last four digits of my social, billing zip code, and Verizon password. Easy peasy. Then: "password invalid." Okay, I'll try again. "Password invalid."</p>
<p>Oh, Apple! Right when I needed you most.</p>
<p>Now, I know there was no way that password was invalid because I had just used it to sign into my Verizon Wireless account in no less than three browsers. What's more, I use 1Password to easily fill or paste passwords, so I was definitely not typing it wrong.</p>
<p>Why me? Why now?</p>
<p>I don't know. I'll probably never know.  But I did get the order in. I decided to call my business address a residential address. That seems to have worked for others. Hopefully it'll work for me.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you're wondering if the Verizon iPhone has anything to do with why <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/02/01/learning-omnifocus/">I'm moving into OmniFocus</a>, the answer is yes. Yes, indeed. More on that later.</p>
