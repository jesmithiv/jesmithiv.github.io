<p>Most of the time when I enter something in my OmniFocus inbox on my iPhone, it’s just a thought or single task. But sometimes thoughts are clearly projects from the outset. And sometimes I even know, say, four or five tasks that should go in the project.</p>
<p>I don’t like entering multiple individual actions on the iPhone. It’s  cumbersome. Selecting contexts, start dates, etc. for each and every task takes time—time that I'd rather spend doing other things.</p>
<p>So I do this instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an inbox action with a project title</li>
<li>List individual actions in the notes section (one on each line)</li>
<li>Save</li>
</ol>
<p>Later, when I’m at my Mac, I can add contexts and other ingredients much more easily. I can also convert the actions listed in the note to individual actions by copying them, then pasting under the project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select and copy tasks in note field</li>
<li>Make sure you have at least one blank action under the project</li>
<li>Make sure that your cursor is not inside the action editing it (i.e. press <code>esc</code> to select the entire action as a unit)</li>
<li>Paste</li>
</ol>
<p>Rocket science, this is not. I just think it’s more efficient to treat the mobile versions of OmniFocus as capture and execution tools. The Mac version of OmniFocus—and to a certain extent, the iPad version—are better for heavy planning and bulk actions.</p>
<p>In any event, I feel more productive when I prioritize capture <em>above</em> organization.</p>
<p>Others will thank you, too. Trying to build a detailed project in any kind of social situation—from boardrooms to evenings with your spouse—is a bad idea. Just get down the bones. You can be all cerebral later.</p>
