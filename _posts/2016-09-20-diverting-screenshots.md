title: Diverting screenshots from the Desktop
---

`Downloads` is by far the busiest folder on my Mac. Almost all files to Downloads before other destinations. [Hazel][h] keeps a watchful eye on `Downloads` and does all sorts of file moving magic, never leaving anything there for more than 24 hours.

For some silly reason I've always accepted that screen shots in OS X (now macOS) are saved directly to the `Desktop`. Today I [*finally* learned][1] that screen shots, too, can go straight to `Downloads` (or any other folder). No more `F11`'ing to view my `Desktop`. Now, like all other download-esque files, I can grab recent screen shots from the fan view of my `Downloads` dock shortcut.
