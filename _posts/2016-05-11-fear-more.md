title: Fear more
---

Focusing your time on a narrower set of priorities is the biggest gut check you can experience in business and life. It is a never-ending fight with your primal self. Feature bloat, mass marketing, and "do it all" are driven by fear, and the internet age enables that fear like no other medium devised by humanity. 

Before you decide to spend time making *more* instead of making something *better*, ask yourself: what am I afraid of?
