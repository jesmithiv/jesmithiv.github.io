<p>I’ve always had a nerdy affection for dictionaries.  When I was a kid, I actually used to read dictionaries for fun.  Yeah, I just admitted that.</p>
<p>So it’s not surprising, to me anyway, that Dictionary.app is one of the most used apps on my Mac.  There’s no telling how many times a day I go there.</p>
<p>Normally I enter Dictionary.app via LaunchBar.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="lb-dict-pe-1.png" src="/img/lb-dict-pe-1.png" border="0" alt="Lb dict pe 1" width="469" height="87" /></p>
<p>I use the triple finger tap in Lion a lot, too.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="triple-tap-dict-pe.png" src="/img/triple-tap-dict-pe.png" border="0" alt="Triple tap dict pe" width="447" height="406" /></p>
<p>Dictionary.app is not a pretentious app.  It does exactly what it’s meant to do: get you in, then back out as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to having access to the full <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em>, you also have a thesaurus, Wikipedia, and even a dictionary of Apple terms.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="dictionary-app-pe.png" src="/img/dictionary-app-pe.png" border="0" alt="Dictionary app pe" width="493" height="175" /></p>
<p>But wait. There’s more.</p>
<p>With Dictionary selected, click Go &gt; Front/Back Matter to view “extras” associated with the <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em>.  You’ll find writing reference help on things like</p>
<ul>
<li>English grammar rules</li>
<li>Spelling guidelines</li>
<li>Capitalization and punctuation guidelines</li>
<li>Clichés to avoid</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also handy lists of common things like</p>
<ul>
<li>Presidents of the US</li>
<li>States of the US</li>
<li>Countries of the world</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll even find the text of the Declaration of Independence and conversion guidelines for standard weights and measures.</p>
<p>Yep, all in little ole Dictionary.app.</p>
