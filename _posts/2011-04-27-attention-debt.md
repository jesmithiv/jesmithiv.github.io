<p>If you&#8217;re a normal human being, you surround yourself with attention debt. </p>
<p>Baskets of unfolded clothes are normal. Dishes in the sink are normal.  Emails that sit in your inbox are normal. Delaying uncomfortable phone calls: <strong>normal</strong>.</p>
<p>Charging the expense of immediate gratification to your attention credit account and sending the bill to your future self is totally normal. </p>
<p>But if you&#8217;d only just spend a few pennies of your time up front, these  loans of attention would never accrete. Better, you&#8217;d spend less periodic attention servicing the compound interest on your life&#8217;s notional liabilities. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s so <em>abnormal</em>, though. It&#8217;s not you. You&#8217;re just like everyone else: Uncomfortably normal and in debt. </p>
