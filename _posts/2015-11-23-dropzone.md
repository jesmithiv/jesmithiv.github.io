<p><a href="https://aptonic.com">Dropzone</a> is the best Mac app I discovered in 2015. It works like the "drop stack" feature in <a href="http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/">Path Finder</a>, but it's available in the menu bar. I use it every day to gather files to attach to emails, open PDFs in specific apps, and more.</p>
