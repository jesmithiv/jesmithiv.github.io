<p>I can’t get rid of paper.  Some utility companies just refuse to offer e-bills. I get insurance statements and EOBs. Honestly, I still get all kinds of crap in my paper mailbox.</p>
<p>Since I was old enough to care what happened to mail after I opened it, I’ve had some kind of scheme for keeping up with it. And at the end of every scheme’s life cycle, I run into the same brick wall conclusion.</p>
<p>Filing cabinets are sideways trash cans.</p>
<p>Stuff goes in. It sits there for years. And it usually doesn’t come out until it’s time to dump it in a waste bin.</p>
<p>If you’re like me – and I’m going to be super presumptuous and say you are since you’re still reading – you’ve probably spent much more effort creating and maintaining paper filing systems than those systems have paid you back in efficiency and saved time.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously. How many times a year do you actually <em>go</em> to your paper file for information? I hardly ever do.  <em>But</em>, I do sometimes need to get stuff.</p>
<h2 id="papereffortyou">Paper, effort, you</h2>
<p><strong>The effort spent filing things should be proportional to the frequency you access your files.</strong></p>
<p>Wha? That’s just me trying to think of a quotable, smart way of saying this:</p>
<p>If you go to your paper file a lot, finding things quickly is valuable. If you go there a handful of times per year, it’s okay if you have to dig for a while each time. Make sense? Hope so.</p>
<p>Try this method on for size:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy the biggest, deepest-pocketed accordion file folder you can find at your local office store.</li>
<li>Label one of those crevasses with the current year.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Stop.</strong> Put the label maker away. Seriously… set it down, and Back. A. Way.</p>
<h2 id="breathe">Breathe</h2>
<p>Hey you, still with me? Cool. Don’t worry: next year, you can label the next crevasse in line.</p>
<p>If you’re used to thinking that a paper filing system isn’t worth a damn unless it has monthly folders, then this probably sounds like a cop out.  It is.  And that’s why it works.</p>
<p>If filing is easy, it happens. If it’s hard, paper forms windrows on your kitchen island.  In fact, let’s just call this “kitchen island zero.” It’s inbox zero for your paper-based world.</p>
<p>When mail arrives, process the hell out of it. Make it gone:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shred junk</li>
<li>Archive stuff you may need in the annual bucket</li>
<li>Jot down tasks (todos) for actionable mail</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="happypapertrails">Partitioning as a service</h2>
<p>The paper tragedy in everyone’s life is different, so you may need some extra differentiation. Maybe you need one or two extra divisions.  But I highly recommend partitioning your paper files no more frequently than annually.</p>
<p>Annual archives just work for me. I’ve found that I spend almost the same amount of time looking for a piece of paper in an aggregate annual bucket than I do looking through monthly folders. Why? Because half the time I don’t even remember what month I should be looking in anyway.</p>
<p>It’s sorta like having a bulging sidebar of email labels (tags) that you never use.</p>
<p>Just try it and see if you like it. Start simple. Add complexity only when needed (that proportional thing again).</p>
<p><em>Note: I will likely get a few emails about using a scanner to go totally paperless.  I flirt with that workflow every so often, but never implement it for various reasons. If I do, you’ll hear from me about it.</em></p>
