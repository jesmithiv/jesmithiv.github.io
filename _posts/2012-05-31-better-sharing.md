<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8914">A little over a year ago, I wrote <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/03/11/securer-file-sharing-with-dropbox/">a post</a> with some ideas for sharing files more securely using Dropbox, and I’m glad I did because it lead to <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/3786441300/dbox-trick">a much better and more useful post</a> on the same topic by Merlin.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8923">The approach in Merlin’s post has worked well for me, but recently I made some changes.</p><h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8926">Less public</h2><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8929">Even with the “handful of paranoid additions involving chaos and automation” in Merlin’s post, I was never completely comfortable using the Public folder.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8932">Links to files in the Public folder look like this:</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8935">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/123456/file.txt</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8938">Each Dropbox user has their own unique numeric Public folder ID (like 123456). And so the path to my Public folder was necessarily advertised each and every time I shared it.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8941">I have no idea if it would actually be possible to “crawl” a Dropbox Public folder, but it seems conceivable. At any rate, the image of an ill-intentioned teenager sitting in an Eastern European basement writing a shell script to ping known Public folders 24 hours a day never sat well with me.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8944">Now that Dropbox lets me create a link to any file in any folder, I’ve abandoned the default Public folder entirely. I now use a custom public folder, which resides in a Dropbox folder <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/07/26/1l-dropbox/">containing all of my other shared folders</a>.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8950">Dropbox’s new <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/167">link-to-any-file-anywhere</a> option just feels more secure (to me). The new syntax looks like this:</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8956">https://www.dropbox.com/s/zahx2ghztxt5mtn/file.txt</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8959">That zahx2ghztxt5mtn bit is random and is different for each and every link you create. There is nothing specific to your account in the URL.</p><h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8962">Better Hazel rules</h2><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8965">I had been using <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> to automatically delete files from my Public folder X days after I put them there, where X was constantly changing because I never could settle on the <em>right</em> amount of time.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8974">It was always frustrating when Hazel would (based on my instructions) remove files before the intended recipient had a chance to download them—especially for non-sensitive files like photos or videos that I share with friends and family.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8977">I'm totally fine with a video of my 13-month-old son slam-dunking a toy basketball goal staying in my public folder for months, but I might want a W-9 form to be publicly available for just a few days.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8980">I finally got smart and thought to vary the lifespan of files by having multiple Hazel rules based on different durations. I now add a time indicator to the end of file names. Some examples:</p><ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8983"><li>_1d for 1 day</li><li>_3d for 3 days</li><li>_1w for 1 week</li><li>_6m for 6 months</li></ul><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8993">If, for example, Hazel sees a file called file_3d.txt, and it’s more than 3 days old, Hazel deletes it.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_8999">This allows me to quickly and easily set the duration of a file’s availability after I’ve copied it to my custom public folder.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1409163142856_9002">I still wouldn’t call this system perfect, but it’s better. Definitely better than email.</p>
