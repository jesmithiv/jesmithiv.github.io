title: Smart Title Case in Sublime Text

<p>Dr. Drang's <a href="http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/06/title-case-in-drafts/">recent post</a> on how to title-case text in Drafts reminded me of one of my most-used Sublime Text packages. Matt Stevens's <a href="https://github.com/mattstevens/sublime-titlecase">sublime-titlecase</a> adds a <code>Smart Title Case</code> menu command that converts text of any case to title case. It's powered by a python script derived from John Gruber's original <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case">Title Case Perl script</a>.</p>

<p>I probably use this command at least a hundred times a week because it works so flawlessly to convert text into a consistent title case format.</p>

<p>One common use: I often sketch out a list of headings in a LaTeX document before filling them in. No matter how I get the headings in—by voice, copy/paste, or just speed typing—I don't have to worry about the case until they're all in. Using a keyboard shortcut I mapped to <code>Smart Title Case</code>, I can convert every line to title case with a single key command (all at once) using Sublime Text's multiple cursors and the <code>Smart Title Case</code> command.</p>
