<p>I joined Rob Agcaoili and Gabe Weatherhead on <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2013/1/13/017-task-management-with-rob-agcaoili-and-eddie-smith.html">episode 17</a> of Generational to talk about some GTD basics: defining tasks and projects. We wanted to make this a sort of "GTD for real people" chat. But the more I think about it, the less I'm sure I represent real people. I'm glad Gabe and Rob were there.</p>
