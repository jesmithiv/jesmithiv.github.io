One day we’ll laugh at today’s cute little computer screens. They’re really funny if you think about it.</p>
<p>Before we had computers, we had the whole physical desktop available to do work.  We could spread things out. Aligning pages side by side was natural.</p>
<p>But then computers happened.  Suddenly our visual workspace shrank to fit a virtual desktop, which itself is just another object sitting next to the pencil holder on our real desktop.  Sure, the new one is a desktop of infinite depth, but our eyes can only see the what's visible on that two-dimensional space at any given time.  It’s like working through a kaleidoscope all day.</p>
<p>As the cost of monitors has fallen, and as their shape has become more space-friendly, more people have picked up a second, third, or fourth screen. I think this is simply a sign that people want to recreate the arm’s length workspace we used to enjoy.</p>
<p>Now that extra screens are dirt cheap, there’s no question that you should run out and buy more, right? Well, before you make your home office look like a Vegas security room, think about how you’ll use that extra viewing area.</p>
<p><strong>Simply put, additional screens make sense when they’re used to leverage one another. They fail when they compete.</strong></p>
<h2 id="goodusesofdualscreens">Good uses of dual screens</h2>
<p>These are all instances where you’re using one screen to “lift” the other.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your task list on one screen while you do work on the other. I find it powerfully productive to have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a> on one screen while I work on the other. It's especially helpful if I’m doing highly technical work with lots of steps, and I want to record a mixture of completed tasks, future tasks, and thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Put a remote server display on one; your local desktop on the other. This lets you easily drag and drop files or use one screen as a reference screen while you work on the other.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make spreadsheets wider, or put two related spreadsheets side by side.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Read PDF on one; write or work on the other.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="badusesofdualscreens">Bad uses of dual screens</h2>
<p>In these cases, you’re probably better off without the extra screen(s) because your brain is constantly trying to figure out which screen is more worthy of your attention every second.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving email, social media, or message boards up on one while you try to work on the other. Bad, bad, bad.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Leaving “old” work up on one, or more generally, leaving visible clutter on one screen that has nothing to do with the task on the other screen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Having a different project/task on each screen. Two screens do not make multi-tasking any easier or more effective, in my opinion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="twomonitorsvsonereallybigone">Two monitors vs one really big one</h2>
<p>I’ve tested both setups. Even though a single big screen has the perception of being the same (or better) than two separate screens, I think you’re better off with separate screens (if you have one of the “good” uses above).</p>
<p>The problem with a big screen is that windows are still likely to overlap. It takes constant to effort to size windows.  With separate screens, it’s far easier to keep individual windows completely visible.</p>
<h2 id="howaboutyou">How about you?</h2>
<p>What’s your optimal number of screens, and how do you use them?</p>
