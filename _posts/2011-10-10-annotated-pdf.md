<p>I often use Preview in Lion to fill out and <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2011/02/26/lions-signature-capture-in-preview-photographs-your-written-signature-to-put-in-pdfs/">sign</a> PDFs before emailing them to various people for various purposes. Normally I let Preview auto-save the PDF, close the file, then drag it into an email message.
A few days ago I sent one of these annotated PDFs to someone (on a PC) that wasn’t able to see <em>anything</em> I had entered in the PDF.</p>
<p>I ended up going back to Preview and did File &gt; Print &gt; PDF &gt; Save As PDF.</p>
<p>That worked. I think the Save As PDF step solidifies the changes you’ve made for other PDF readers. I noticed that the text and signature elements were no longer draggable/editable in the version created by Save As PDF.</p>
