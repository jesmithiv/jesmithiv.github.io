<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8">Mr. Reader</a> on my iPad a lot lately. I still think that <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-for-ipad/id375661689?mt=8">Reeder</a> is a more aesthetically pleasing place to read, but Mr. Reader has a few bells and whistles that make RSS feed management easier.</p>
<p>Like the designers of <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/08/29/soulver/">my favorite touch calculator</a>, Soulver, the makers of Mr. Reader have embraced the the “press and hold” concept to add useful features without cluttering the interface.</p>
<p>For example, if you press and hold the blue read/unread dot, you’re given the option of marking items read above or below that point.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mrreader-pe.png" src="/img/mrreader-pe.png" border="0" alt="Mrreader pe" width="584" height="285" /></p>
<p>You can also mark items read based on their age by pressing and holding the ‘Mark all as read’ button.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="mrreader-age-pe.png" src="/img/mrreader-age-pe.png" border="0" alt="Mrreader age pe" width="313" height="439" /></p>
<p>Other really useful feed management tools in Mr. Reader:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add new feeds</li>
<li>Remove feeds</li>
<li>Move feeds to different folders</li>
<li>Add and remove folders or tags themselves</li>
</ul>
<p>I also like how Mr. Reader remembers my last chosen article view. For example, if I last chose Readability to view the full text of a partial text feed, Mr. Reader applies that choice the next time I view an article in that feed. In effect, it transforms partial text feeds into full text feeds with no extra taps on my part.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Reader relies on Google Reader as a source for RSS feeds, there's no reason you have to abandon Reeder—or anything else that uses Google Reader. Everything syncs.</p>
