<h2 id="thegood">The good</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Text is gorgeous. No backlit screen has ever come so close to paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My eyes don’t strain late at night, even after working late.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m probably going to use the iPad even more because looking at it is so much easier than looking at any other display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speech dictation is awesome, fast, and accurate. Last weekend, I dictated an entire home project into my iPad as I walked room to room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Battery life is at least as good as what I experience with the first iPad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s easily the <em>fastest</em> device I’ve ever used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thebad">The bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use the new iPad next to your MacBook. The new iPad makes every other display look worse. It’s <em>that</em> good.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theconclusion">The conclusion</h2>
<p>Is this the future of computing? Yes. But we won’t use words like  “computing” much longer.</p>
