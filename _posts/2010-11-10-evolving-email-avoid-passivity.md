<p><a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/tag/evolving-email"><em>Evolving email</em></a><em> is a series about putting yourself in the inbox of the recipient and getting more value out of the time you spend on the task of writing email.</em>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Suppose you get this email from your boss:</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to get that new proposal wrapped up.  Sections 4 and 7 need the most work.  You and Jack should probably split these up and get it done by this Friday or Monday.</p></blockquote>
<p>What’s wrong with this email? Well, here are a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>We really means <em>you</em>.</li>
<li>Who is supposed to work on each section?</li>
<li>Is the proposal due Friday or Monday?</li>
</ol>
<p>But the biggest problem is this: <strong>Additional emails will probably be exchanged to clarify the situation.</strong></p>
<p>What the bossman should’ve said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please finish section 7 of the proposal by Friday. I’m assigning section 4 to Jack.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why this version is better:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s perfectly clear what your boss wants you to do and when.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="avoidsendingthepassiveemail">Avoid sending the passive email</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t say “we” when you mean “you.”</li>
<li>Be clear about directions.</li>
<li>Be clear about deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a boss and you find yourself having this problem a lot, maybe you aren’t comfortable delegating things.  Just remember that that’s one of your jobs. Delegating, that is.</p>
<p>And trust me. Your employees prefer clear, concise directions over vague, ambiguous ones.</p>
<p>The clearer you are, the clearer they are about what they have to do. And best of all, it minimizes time wasted writing and reading email.  More gets done.</p>
<p>As I’ve said before, people read email for information, not pleasure. Deliver information clearly, concisely, and profit.</p>
<p>Let your boss have it in the comments.</p>
