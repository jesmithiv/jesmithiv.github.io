<p>I completely agree with this opinion piece. Mobile technology is here to stay, and we’ve only just seen the beginning. The benefits to your personal and business life are immense. If you don’t own a smart phone, or if you’re a manager who is reluctant to give your employees mobile access, it’s time to rethink that mindset. Mobile technology, with its risks and rewards, are not going away. Avoidance is not a wise solution.</p>
