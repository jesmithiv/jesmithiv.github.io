<p>Brett and I rambled nostalgic about Notational Velocity forks, ran barefoot across the socio-political-economic mine field of U.S. health insurance, and discussed the power usage of mind maps in almost perverse way. I'm of course referring to <a href="http://www.esn.fm/systematic/143">episode 143</a> of Systematic, which I had fun being a part of. </p>
