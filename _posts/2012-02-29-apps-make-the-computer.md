<p><a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/iOS/features.html">PDFpen for iPad</a> is one of the most recent additions to an ever-growing list of iPad apps that let me leave my MacBook Air at home.</p>
<p>Today I was working with a PDF where the security was set to prohibit copying text. To fix the problem, I opened the PDF in PDFpen on my iPad and then emailed a printable (flattened) copy back to myself.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The result was a copiable PDF.</p>
<p>It's amazing how much you can do with relatively inexpensive apps on the iPadâ€”things that would have required really expensive, overkill PC software just a few short years ago.</p>

<p>Yes, I had every legal right and need to be able to copy its contents. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that you break the security on PDFs for malicious reasons.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
