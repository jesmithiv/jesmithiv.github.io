<p>I’ve not had great success finding non-Apple USB ports that supply enough power to charge my iPhone and iPad. Until recently.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006P4MNRI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=practiceffici-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006P4MNRI">PowerCurve Mobile Surge Protector</a> works really well. As far as I can tell, it charges my iPhone and iPad just as fast as the wall charger that Apple ships with new iOS devices.</p>
<p>The PowerCurve is very compact. It’ll fit in any travel bag. I even keep one plugged in behind my night stand so that I can easily charge my iPhone and iPad in the same spot.</p>
<p>At $20, it's cheaper (and more practical) than loading up on Apple wall chargers.</p>
<p>The number of iOS devices in my extended family has grown geometrically in the last year. There's no such thing as too many USB ports.</p>
<p><strong>Update (3/20/2012)</strong>: I've found that the PowerCurve does not fully charge the new iPad (3rd generation), so I would not recommend it for the new iPad.</p>
