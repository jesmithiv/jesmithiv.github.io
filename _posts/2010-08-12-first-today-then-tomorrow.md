<p>If you like reading my ramblings about future states of technology and computer design, then you're sure to enjoy Randy Murray's blog <a href="http://whowritesforyou.com/">First Today, then Tomorrow</a>. I had the pleasure of discovering Randy's writing very recently.
One series you might want to check out first is <a href="http://whowritesforyou.com/2010/08/02/what’s-next-five-predictions-about-the-future/">What’s Next? Five Predictions About The Future</a>. Great stuff.</p>
