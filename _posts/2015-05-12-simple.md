<p><a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2015/05/beware-simple-stories.html">Wonderful words by Gabe</a>, who is "skeptical of big problems with small answers." I agree completely with him, especially when it comes to the modern era of quick-shot journalism based on cherry-picked chunks of "science" and crumbs of big data.</p>

<p>I'm not ready to condemn TED culture and pop science, though. I think emerging science-flavored forms of entertainment can serve a vital purpose in our society. If a kid in 2015 gets turned on to a story "without end," to borrow Gabe's words, by watching a TED video or the like, I'm good with that.</p>

<p>I think entertainment is a vital ingredient in sparking interest, but I agree it's not the final answer, and it's definitely not a substitute for requisite complexity.</p>

<p>If it's possible to describe the ideal purpose of any human action in a single sentence, I believe Einstein did it with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that when it comes to understanding the world, simplicity must precede complexity, and I think it's the fundamental duty of knowledgeable adults to provide simple foundations to those less knowledgeable. I think any means that accomplishes that goal is justifiedâ€”provided that it's done to advance knowledge and not end it.</p>
