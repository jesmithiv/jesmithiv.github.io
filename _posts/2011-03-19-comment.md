<p>As my writing experience here has matured, I’ve realized that this site doesn’t have one home page.  It has, as of today, about 250.  That’s the number of posts I’ve published here, and it’s a figure that blows my mind.
It also means there are, thanks to Google, 250 opportunities for someone to leave a comment here every single hour of the day.  And comment people do.</p>
<p>It’s great, and I love it.  But clearly, the numbers no longer allow me to reply to every single comment.</p>
<p>That said, I can assure you of this: I read every single one.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and thank you for commenting. Yeah, even when you disagree. Sometimes I need a reality check.</p>
