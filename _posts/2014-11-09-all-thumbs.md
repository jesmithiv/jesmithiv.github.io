<blockquote>
  <p>I originally thought the iPad would be a perfect writing device but I never found the right keyboard solution. The iPad keyboard is too big for me to happily thumb type on, and I also never enjoyed 10 finger typing on it (doable but uncomfortable). And carrying around an external keyboard started to make me want to just go with the laptop.</p>
  
  <p>The portrait keyboard on the iPhone 6 Plus is just right for me. It works great for fast, two-handed thumb typing, which suits my creative writing pace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally agree, even though I'm using an itty-bitty iPhone 6. It's logical to <em>expect</em> the iPad to be superior to the iPhone for writing because the iPad's keyboard is larger. In practice, the opposite is true. </p>

<p>A few reasons why. . .</p>

<p><strong>Body position matters for the iPad, not the iPhone.</strong></p>

<p>Typing landscape on an iPad is optimal only when sitting in a traditional "laptop" position, ideally at a table or desk. It's maddeningly frustrating in any other body position—especially positions that you <em>really</em> wish it worked in. For example, trying to type on an iPad in your lap while sitting on a sofa <em>seems</em> like a good idea, but that's only if you enjoy being punched in the balls by autocorrect every four seconds. </p>

<p>The position of my body is practically irrelevant when I type on an iPhone. I can stand, sit, or even lay on my back. In every case, the iPhone is in the same orientation with the same degree of thumb accessibility.</p>

<p>I'm sure Yuvi would agree that an iPad just <em>doesn't</em> work in his "sweet setup" for writing—<a href="http://yuvizalkow.com/videos/writinganovel/">the toilet</a>. </p>

<p><strong>If I <em>can't</em> touch type, just let me have my thumbs.</strong> </p>

<p>I can type on an iPhone in portrait orientation with two thumbs just as fast as I can touch type on an iPad in landscape. Even when sitting in a traditional typing position with an iPad, I'm not creating more words per minute. </p>

<p><strong>My iPhone is with me all the time; my iPad isn't.</strong> </p>

<p>My iPad is with me about as often as a laptop is with me. My iPhone, on the other hand, might as well be grafted to my skin. Even if the time spent per typing session is less on an iPhone compared to an iPad or laptop, there are <em>way</em> more iPhone sessions.</p>

<p><strong>My iPhone typing speed promotes a more <em>discerning</em> type of typing.</strong></p>

<p>This is really more of a comparison to laptop typing, I guess. I think it's also what Yuvi meant when he said the iPhone "suits his creative writing pace." I couldn't agree more. I just type too damn fast at a "real" keyboard. My emails sometimes read like they were written by a third-grader vomiting words into the IMAP sewer that <em>is</em> unedited, high-volume work email. </p>

<p>When I type on an iPhone, I usually write fewer and richer sentences. I make fewer typos, too. </p>

<p><strong>It's not that I don't use my iPad a lot.</strong></p>

<p>I just don't use it much for writing. My iPad time is almost entirely spent reading technical papers, books, or watching Netflix. For me, my iPad is a natural extension of my Mac's screen when working, and it provides the best experience for reading text—just not creating it. </p>
