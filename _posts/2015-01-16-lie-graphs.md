<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, then times have never been better for people who want to tell long lies to audiences with short attention spans. Last year, Eric Portelance wrote a great piece for Medium where he <a href="https://medium.com/i-data/misleading-with-statistics-c63780efa928">dissected a fantastic falsehood</a> told through a Bloomberg graph of U.S. men's income. </p>

<p>Maybe I'm just getting cranky with age, but I've just gotten so cynical about graphics posted in mainstream placesâ€”from news articles to Twitter. Whenever I see a graph or chart depicting any kind of trend in any kind of data, I assume it's been designed to mislead me. A very recent example: The Economist mixed a nice cocktail of confirmation bias, anchoring bias, and data truncation into a graph of <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21638140-gun-now-more-likely-kill-you-car-bangers-v-bullets?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/ed/bangersvbullets">shooting deaths versus automobile deaths</a>. </p>

<p>Line graphs, bar charts, and all their two-dimensional friends can be wonderfully effective story tellers. But sadly, it's not always apparent whether the genre is fiction or non-. Most people today don't have the time to check before clicking share.</p>
