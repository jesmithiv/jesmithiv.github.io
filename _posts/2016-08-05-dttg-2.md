title: DEVONthink To Go 2
---

As a quick follow-up to my "[state of my content address][pe]," [DEVONthink To Go 2][d] is now [in the App Store][as]. And it's wonderful. The best all-media content manager for the Mac now has the iOS companion app it deserves. 

DTTG isn't just a bandaid for my Evernote problems. It's vastly superior for my uses. There are multiple options for syncing data, everything is encrypted in transit and storage, and the sync granularity is unrivaled. I can finally feel comfortable syncing sensitive documents like tax forms, and I can maintain massive archives of non-synced data on my Mac and local network without having them blow up the size of the databases on my iPhone. A place for everything.
