Modern survival is antithetical to everything evolution programed us for. Today we have to:

1. Eat *much* less than is available
2. Move *much* more than we *have* to
3. Take *many more* daily risks than we *have* to

Today, complacency is the tiger rustling in the bushes. Vulnerability *is* the key to longevity.
