<p>For the past couple of days, I’ve been trying to draft my interpretation of Merlin’s deeply touching essay, <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2011/04/22/cranking">Cranking</a>. But I finally concluded that <em>my</em> interpretation would be written too much to myself. An epic piece like Cranking will move everyone differently. If you haven’t read it yet, do.</p>
<p>Make some time to watch his <a href="http://vimeo.com/21730173">Webstock presentation on fear</a>, too. Have a box of tissue handy.</p>
