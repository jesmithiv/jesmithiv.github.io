<p>On this day in 1776, some very brave people had the larger-than-life stones to declare independence from an oppressive empire. They wanted freedom so badly they were willing to risk every security they possessed—their wealth, their land, their blood, their children's blood.</p>
<p>Kinda makes the idea of freeing yourself from the oppressors in your life not such a big deal, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Celebrate independence, especially that which you win for yourself.</p>
