<p>Most mobile data pricing plans are set up like an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Regardless of your device, you’re probably paying a fixed price per month.  <strong>Reality</strong>: No way that will last.</p>
<p>Being with Verizon, my wife and I each pay $30 per month for unlimited data. To me, however, it’s more interesting what we’re paying <em>per KB</em> for each device.  I have an iPhone, and she has a Blackberry.</p>
<p>Over the last twelve months, I’ve used an average of 647,311 KB each month.<a id="fnref:f1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f1">1</a> My wife, on the other hand, chewed through only 17,013 KB—though she uses her Blackberry quite a bit.</p>
<p>That’s a huge difference in <em>consumption</em> for the same price—0.17 cents per KB to be exact.  (Scale that against the countless GBs of mobile data flitting through the air right now.)</p>
<p>I highly doubt our case is an outlier either.<a id="fnref:f2" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f2">2</a> A Blackberry simply isn’t equipped to consume the data an iPhone or Android phone can—no matter how many flustered hours you spend trying to use the circa 2004 Blackberry web browser.</p>
<h2 id="thankyoublackberryusersoftheworldfornow">Thank you Blackberry users of the world—for now</h2>
<p>As the Blackberry continues to retreat from mobile market share graphs, I think it will be interesting to see what happens to data pricing once this subsidy dries up—or less likely, when the Blackberry catches up to its competition.</p>
<p>If $30 per month is the “right” price for today’s aggregate data appetite, what happens when everyone is carrying a real app phone with a real browser? It's just one more reason I think data prices will rise before they fall.</p>
<p>But for now, I just want to say thanks, Blackberry users. I really appreciate your help paying for my data. It's sweet of you. And: Hold out as long as you can, okay?</p>

<p>In February, I switched from an Android phone to the iPhone, but there was no appreciable difference in monthly data usage.<a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:f1"> ↩</a></p>

<p>In fact, my level of data usage is probably on the low end for an iPhone user, so the disparity in other iPhone-Blackberry households is probably even greater.<a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:f2"> ↩</a></p>
