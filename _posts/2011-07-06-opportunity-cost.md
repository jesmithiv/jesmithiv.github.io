<p>My new <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacast/id420368235?mt=8">Instacast</a> habit has made perusing podcast archives way easier. I just stumbled across this Merlin nugget in <a href="http://5by5.tv/pipeline/7">5by5’s The Pipeline, episode 7</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything you do in life has an opportunity cost… You don’t want to obsess so much over opportunity cost that you’re always calculating fake money, but at the same time, every time you agree to do something, you tacitly agree not to do ten thousand other things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So practical, I could hug that paragraph.</p>
