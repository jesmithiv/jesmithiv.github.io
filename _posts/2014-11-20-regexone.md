<p>I've always known I'd be better off if I knew how to write regular expressions, but for some reason I never had the patience to teach myself through web searches and online manuals. </p>

<p>Thankfully I just came across <a href="http://regexone.com">RegexOne</a>, a site with interactive tutorials and practical examples using regular expressions. Now I <em>finally</em> know how to write simple regular expressions and know enough to figure out more complex regular expressions when the need arises.</p>

<p>I really like sites that teach with real-time feedback. RegexOne's teaching model is great. </p>
