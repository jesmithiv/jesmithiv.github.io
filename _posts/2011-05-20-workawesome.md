<p>Many, many internet moons ago—back in February of this year to be exact—I had the pleasure of speaking with Mike Vardy on his WorkAwesome podcast.  If you want to hear my initial thoughts on OmniFocus, which I was just starting to use back then, as well as other general thoughts on productivity, <a href="http://workawesome.com/podcast/eddie-smith/">check it out</a>.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re over there in WorkAwesome land, be sure to peruse the archives. Or better, just subscribe in iTunes like I do. True to his title, Mike has interviewed some really awesome folks.</p>
