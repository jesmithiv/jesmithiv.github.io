<p>I don't often dive into topical Apple news on this site, but I can't help but comment on the Congressional inquiry into Apple's corporate taxes. The typical headline reads "Apple avoids billions in US taxes."</p>

<p>And the typical response from the mostly uninformed, emotional public is "how can Apple get away with paying a lower average tax rate than me?"</p>

<p>And that's a good question to ask. Just not to Apple.</p>

<p>Apple isn't doing anything that the rest of the Fortune 500 hasn't been doing the last few years (though I'll concede that Apple appears to be doing it <em>better</em>).</p>

<p>Washington Post writer Jia Lynn Yang back in March of this year:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that from 2009 to 2011, Microsoft was able to shift offshore almost half its net revenue from U.S. retail sales, or roughly $21 billion, by transferring intellectual-property rights to a Puerto Rican subsidiary.</p>
  
  <p>As a result, the subcommittee found Microsoft saved as much as $4.5 billion in taxes on products sold in this country. [<a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020655271_posttaxesxml.html">source</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's that "b" word again. Boeing, Proctor &amp; Gamble, and other major companies that do significant business abroad all play by the same rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any dollar earned abroad does not get taxed by the U.S. government until it flows back to the parent company. A J.P. Morgan report estimates that $1.7 trillion in foreign earnings is being held overseas by more than 1,000 U.S. firms, yet to be taxed by the federal government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put the CEO of any of these companies in front of Congress, and they'll probably all say the same thing: "We're playing by the rules you wrote into law."</p>

<p>If these hearings cause the American public to <em>reverse</em> the hearings and ask Congress why the tax code has lagged so far behind the realities of modern big business, the hearings will be a good thing.</p>

<p>I recommend benchmarking the average tax rates paid by Fortune 500 multinationals with the average tax rates paid by small domestic businesses and self employed individuals. </p>

<p>Something about our way of life is broken if an American entrepreneur or small business pays 20% or more in average taxes while billion-dollar multinationals pay far less than that. In some cases, they pay <a href="http://www.ctj.org/pdf/12corps060111.pdf">negative taxes</a>.</p>
