<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow">The Big Web Show</a>, hosted by 5by5’s Jeffrey Zeldman and Dan Benjamin, has earned a permanent spot in my weekly podcast lineup. If you enjoy hearing interviews with inspiring internet-famous folks that just ooze inspiration, keep your ear on this one.
Here are three episodes I’ve recently enjoyed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/29">Episode 29: Matt Mullenweg.</a> Matt is the founding developer of WordPress. Anyone who blogs (or reads blogs) on the .org or .com flavor of WordPress owes him a big thanks for his creation. In this episode, he also mentions the adjacent possible, a concept <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/28/the-adjacent-possible/">I wrote a bit about</a> not long ago. (Hat tip to <a href="http://bobulate.com/post/2094548510/adjacent-possibilities">Bobulate</a> for bringing this one to my attention.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/26">Episode 26: Gary Vaynerchuck.</a> I loved his book <em>Crush It</em> and eagerly await his next, <em>The Thank You Economy</em>. If you don’t want to run out and build an empire, found a charity, or save an endangered species after hearing Gary talk for ten minutes, there’s something wrong with you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/10">Episode 10: Jason Fried.</a> Jason, CEO and co-founder of 37 Signals, really gets the new knowledge economy. This entire episode is great, but the end is a fireworks show of insight. “Less is always an option.” So good; so, so good.</li>
</ul>
