<p>Last year, Slate released a podcast called <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/working.html">Working</a>. The host, David Plotz, interviewed people will all kinds of jobs just to find out what they do all day.</p>

<p>When I came across this podcast, I figured I would listen to part of one episode, then move on. Instead, I listened to all of them—almost hanging on every word. I just have this fascination with what people do with their time and how people define "work."</p>

<p>As fascinating as it was to hear the different aspects of people's jobs—from a porn star to a hospice nurse—it was far more enlightening to hear just how <em>similar</em> skilled people are. Even though they apply their skills in really different contexts, highly professional people approach their work with a fundamental and universal sense of caring. Well, maybe not the waiter.</p>

<p>I hope there's a sequel. </p>
