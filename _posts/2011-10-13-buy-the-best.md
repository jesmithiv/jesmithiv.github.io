<p>I completely agree with <a href="http://nerdgap.com/trying-decide-between-iphone-4-4s/">Brett Kelly</a> that the one-time savings of buying an older iPhone aren’t worth it.</p>
<p>Over the course of a two-year contract, you’re going to spend $2000+ on service. The $100-$200 you’d save by going with the 3GS or 4 is a poor trade in relative terms. Buying an older phone just means you’ll get less value out of the service, which costs the same no matter what.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/24/irrationality-and-mobile-apps/">irrationality of avoiding apps that cost more than $0</a>.</p>
