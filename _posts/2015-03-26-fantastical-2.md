<p>There are lots of reviews of the new <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical 2 for Mac</a>, but <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/fantastical-2-for-mac-review-reinvented/">Federico Viticci's</a> and <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2015/3/fantastical-2-mac">David Sparks's</a> cover pretty much anything you need to know. The original Fantastical for Mac was "just" a menu bar app. Even so, it has easily been my most-used calendar interface the last two-plus years because it makes entering events and reminders so effortless. (Quick tip: Use <code>âŒ˜K</code> to toggle between events and reminders while in the event entry field.)</p>

<p>At first I was meh to the new full-window version of Fantastical 2. I mean, I already have that in Calendar.app, right? But in the short time I've had Fantastical 2 installed, I can say I <em>really</em> like the agenda/month combo in a single view. It's nice being able to visualize a full month or week for time-blocking purposes while still seeing a linear agenda on the left side. Having Fantastical's legendary natural language field right at hand in the same window is great, too.</p>

<p>I can see how any third-party calendar would be a tough sell for most people since the built in Mac Calendar is pretty good and familiar. But I really think calendars are the most important productivity tools there are. In fact, I would say knowing how to <em>really</em> use a calendar is more important than any task management system. I'm totally willing to buy anything that helps me understand and manage my time.</p>

<p>Right now I just can't think of a better way to make a desktop calendar app than Fantastical 2.</p>
