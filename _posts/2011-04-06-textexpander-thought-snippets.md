<p>What’s next? A TextExpander add-on that reads my mind circumnavigating my keyboard entirely?
One can only dream about the future of text expansion. And a brighter future it seems to be every day. ‘Cause here in the real and now – even <em>IRL</em><a id="fnref:f1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f1">1</a> for some of us – things are pretty fantastic, and they keep getting better.</p>
<p>The ever creative and able-fingered Brett Terpstra, as you may know, has whipped up a very useful <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/new-textexpander-downloads-with-custom-prefixes/">web-based utility</a> for applying your own abbreviations TextExpander snippets shared by others.</p>
<p>And right on the heels of Mr. Terpstra is the venerable Dr. Drang, who’s already served up a <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/04/snippet-surgery/">Python script</a> that you should definitely check out before <em>uploading</em> your own snippets.</p>
<p><strong>Since there’s so much interest in TextExpander these days…</strong></p>
<p>As much as I use TextExpander every day, I often wonder how much text I’m still typing needlessly.  I’ve dreamt of a tool that watches what I type for a few days,<a id="fnref:f2" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f2">2</a> then does some kind of semantic processing to identify common phrases – phrases that I could hand over to TextExpander. A concordance report of sorts, you know?</p>
<p>So if you’re able, and you’re looking for ideas…</p>
