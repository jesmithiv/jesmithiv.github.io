<p>To my RSS readers:
Thank you for reading. Since I started fondling my keyboard regularly here about six months ago, you've trickled in continuously. And now,Â as a group, you're more than 1,000 strong.</p>
<p>The biggest payment you can give me is staying subscribed.</p>
<p>The more of you there are, the more challenged I feel to do a better job of choosing and arranging the words I publish here. I like being challenged, and I like meeting those of you that share my passions for efficient productivity, technology that works, and creativity.</p>
<p>So again, thank you for reading; thank you for staying subscribed.</p>
