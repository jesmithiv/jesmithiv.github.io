<p>You ordered a side of soup. They gave you fries. You like fries. You eat the fries.</p>
<p>The farther you are above the poverty line, the more likely you are not to pursue reparations that clink in a piggy bank. The justification: it’s not worth your time.</p>
<p>From a purely rational economic standpoint, that’s probably true. Your time is worth $X per hour, and it would take Y too many hours to pursue, where Y × X is too big to measure in nickels and dimes.</p>
<p>There’s another view worth considering.</p>
<p>Every time you get stiffed, whether it’s because your cable provider raised your monthly bill by $1.19 or because a gas pump said you put 20.7 gallons in your 20-gallon tank, it’s an opportunity. A drill.</p>
<p>It’s a chance to practice one of the most valuable skills anyone can possess: knowing how to ask for what you want. And getting it more often than not.</p>
<p>The immediate dollar value of righting a tiny little wrong is small, but the downstream payoff can be immense if you get good at it. And by good, I mean comfortable.</p>
<p>Today it’s about $1.05. One day it could be about $1.05 million. Practice may not make perfect, but it usually makes money.</p>
