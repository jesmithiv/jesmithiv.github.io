<p>Being a savvy citizen of the web, you probably already knew this but…</p>
<p>Google’s search field is an awesome and highly practical calculator. I use it on a regular basis for quick calculations, often when I’ve copied large numbers from some other application.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="google-calc-pe.png" src="/img/google-calc-pe2.png" border="0" alt="Google calc pe" width="528" height="146" /></p>
<p>I particularly like how well Google handles commas, which for some reason seem to stump many other calculators.<a id="fnref:f1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f1">1</a> It also handles parentheses, exponentiation, and pretty much any other mathematical operator you throw at it. Unit conversions are no problem either.</p>
<p>Power user tip: Since each calculation generates a new web page, your web browser’s history turns into a calculation ticker tape. Chrome’s HTML history page is especially good at this. Very useful for jumping back to prior steps.</p>

<p>Like Spotlight, for example. LaunchBar’s calculator, on the other hand, handles commas pretty well.<a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:f1"> ↩</a></p>
