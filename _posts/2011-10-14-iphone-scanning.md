<p>Dr. Drang has <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/10/jotnot/">good things to say about JotNot</a>, an app that turns your iPhone into a document scanner. I really like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-scan-multipage/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a>, which is very similar to JotNot. I use Scanner Pro nearly every week to convert paper to PDF when I'm away from a conventional scanner. The quality is incredibly good.</p>
