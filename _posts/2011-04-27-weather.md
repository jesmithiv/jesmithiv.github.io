<p>If you’re looking for concise reviews of iOS weather apps, Ben Brooks is your guy. He’s got some great thoughts on weather apps for both the <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/04/weather/">iPhone</a> and <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/04/seasonality/">iPad</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve always been kind of a weather nerd. I don’t know why. I’ve also never been totally happy with any single weather app on <em>any</em> mobile platform I’ve ever used.</p>
<p>My main weather app on my iPhone is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weather-alert-usa/id314502416?mt=8">Weather Alert USA</a>. Pretty it’s not, but it’s <em>fast</em> and information-rich. It also offers really comprehensive alerts for severe weather and other weird events you might be interested in.</p>
