<p>After seeing <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/12/13/need-better-text-hygiene-try-cleanhaven/">my writeup of the text utility CleanHaven</a> a few days ago, reader Eric was nice enough to send me a link to another handy text cleaning tool: DEVON Technology’s WordService.
Being a service, not an app, WordService is available for duty just about everywhere, where everywhere = Cocoa apps and such.</p>
<p>To use WordService, just select the text you want to clean up, then go to the Services menu. Click Reformat. Even better, use the keyboard shortcut Command-&amp;.</p>
<p><a href="/img/wordservice-pe.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2568" title="wordservice-pe" src="/img/wordservice-pe.png" alt="" width="586" height="82" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>I’m finding that WordService is really handy for cleaning up small chunks of text on the fly. For example, when I copy text from PDF documents, there are usually lots of unwelcome returns. WordService's Reformat routine zaps all that cruft in one shot.</p>
<p>WordService is free.  You can find a download link at <a href="http://www.devon-technologies.com/download/index.html">DEVON’s download page</a>. Simply copy the .service file to your services folder, ~/Library/Services, and you're all set.</p>
<p>What services are you using to streamline your text workflows?</p>
