<p>Amy Chua wrote a fascinating essay for the Wall Street Journal called "<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html?mod=WSJ_hp_mostpop_read">Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior</a>." Even if you aren't a parent, I strongly recommend reading this article and thinking about its many important themes.
In case you're time-strapped, I've pulled out a few pieces that really spoke to me.</p>
<blockquote><p>In one study of 50 Western American mothers and 48 Chinese immigrant mothers, almost 70% of the Western mothers said either that "stressing academic success is not good for children" or that "parents need to foster the idea that learning is fun." By contrast, roughly 0% of the Chinese mothers felt the same way.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead:</p>
<blockquote><p>What Chinese parents understand is that nothing is fun until you're good at it. To get good at anything you have to work, and children on their own never want to work, which is why it is crucial to override their preferences.</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tenacious practice, practice, practice is crucial for excellence; rote repetition is underrated in America. Once a child starts to excel at something—whether it's math, piano, pitching or ballet—he or she gets praise, admiration and satisfaction. This builds confidence and makes the once not-fun activity fun. This in turn makes it easier for the parent to get the child to work even more.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why failure avoidance turns into success avoidance:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Western parents are extremely anxious about their children's self-esteem. They worry about how their children will feel if they fail at something, and they constantly try to reassure their children about how good they are notwithstanding a mediocre performance on a test or at a recital. In other words, Western parents are concerned about their children's psyches. Chinese parents aren't. They assume strength, not fragility, and as a result they behave very differently.</p></blockquote>
