<p>I recently found out about a great free text editor through one of my favorite Mac blogs, <a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/726967015/fraise-powerful-lightweight-editor-for-mac">Minimal Mac</a>.
<a href="http://www.fraiseapp.com/">Fraise</a> is a completely free text editor for your Mac. I don't do a lot of programming, but I do open HTML and CSS files a good bit. The syntax highlighting is very convenient.</p>
<p>If you're looking for something a little more robust than TextEdit, check out Fraise. I've been really pleased with it.</p>
