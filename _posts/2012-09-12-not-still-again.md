<p>Because this site is essentially a postmodernist sideshow of my life, things don't always appear here in chronological order. I've made some big changes in my life and career recently that I haven't really discussed at all here. I'm sure I will when I figure out what I want to say about it.</p>

<p>But I did want to mention one very important thing my new schedule has afforded me.</p>

<p>For the last six months or so, I've been spread way too thin across paid and non-paid pursuits. Exercise was just one thing I felt forced to give up to get it all done.</p>

<p>When I'm not regularly exercising, it takes me a lot longer to feel tired at the end of the day. So I stay up later. I feel wired. And I feel like a sloth when I get out of bed in the morning.</p>

<p>Now that I've simplified my life somewhat, I'm running again regularly. And it feels great. I feel naturally tired at the end of the day, and I feel a lot sharper first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Physical activity and sleep are precious, intertwined things that have become tragically undervalued in our culture of double-digit hour workdays.</p>

<p>There will always be good life reasons that make putting off exercise necessary: special family circumstances, the birth of a child, illness, etc.</p>

<p>But if you're putting off exercise simply because you feel like you can get more done in that 30-45 minutes, that's almost never a good reason. Reminding your body that it <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/05/09/sedentary">wasn't meant to be still</a> all day is one of the single best things you can do to make a better product the rest of the day.</p>
