<p><a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/markdownmail/">MarkdownMail</a> is a very cool little app that lets you compose emails in Markdown and convert to HTML right on your iOS device.
It works exactly as advertised.  You can write or paste a chunk of Markdown text, preview it in HTML, then send. Bonus: It even supports TextExpander touch.</p>
<p>While I often write in Markdown and MultiMarkdown in Simplenote, I never thought about doing the file conversion on an iOS device (until now).  MarkdownMail provides a whole new world of possibilities by giving you a Markdown converter that goes everywhere you go.</p>
<p>Beyond its obvious use (sending HTML-based emails to people), MarkdownMail provides a nifty way to make HTML-formatted blog posts from your iOS device.</p>
<p>While some blog platforms like Tumblr <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/36234584/markdown-now-supported-via-email-mobile">will convert Markdown to HTML for you</a>, most donâ€™t. But many blog platforms will accept HTML and post it as-is.</p>
<p>I can envision a mobile workflow where you write in Simplenote and use MarkdownMail to do the file conversion.</p>
<p>At only $1.99, MarkdownMail is probably a must-have productivity app for the mobile web writer. If you come up with a creative use for MarkdownMail, share it in the comments.</p>
