<p>On the road. Vacation has <em>finally</em> started. <em>Finally</em> sweet relief. Time to relax.</p>
<p>T-minus 3, 2, 1. Pipe dream turns to pipe bomb: An hour or so into the drive, thoughts begin to arrive: “Did I lock the back door?”</p>
<p>For the next five hours of your drive, you won’t be looking forward to your vacation. You’ll be wondering if that goddamn door is locked… or unlocked… or locked… or…</p>
<p>And you’ll start working through all the horrible scenarios that walk through that might-be-open door and put their feet up in your mind.</p>
<h2 id="diffusingtherecurringattentiontimebombsoftravel">Defusing the recurring attention time bombs of travel</h2>
<p>I can’t help you go back in time, and I can’t help you teleport back to your back door, but I can give you some advice.</p>
<p>You’re probably already good at making lists, especially before traveling. Writing down things like pants, socks, toothbrush is obvious. That's great. Consider your back patted.</p>
<p>But quite honestly, it takes more than a packed bag to leave to house for a weekend or week, doesn’t it? You also need to remember things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arm security system</li>
<li>Lock all doors</li>
<li>Close windows</li>
<li>Turn down or turn off heating and AC</li>
<li>Check to see if the iron is unplugged</li>
<li>Turn off all lights</li>
</ul>
<p>In OmniFocus, I keep these things in a generic a packing project template,<a id="fnref:f1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:f1">1</a> and I check them off <em>as I do them</em>.  It’s the best assurance I can give my future self that I actually did these things.</p>
<p>Investing just a little forethought in the form of an OmniFocus packing project can take you miles and miles toward enjoying your vacation more—before you ever hit the road.</p>

<p>I keep my project templates in a ‘Templates’ folder at the top level of my OmniFocus project Library. I keep template projects ‘On Hold’. When I want to call one into action, I duplicate it (Cmd-D), then drag it to the appropriate life compartment (folder), then make it active. For packing projects, I use a ‘Packing’ context. This best represents the frame of mind I’m in when execute actions—even the ones that don’t land in luggage.<a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:f1"> ↩</a></p>
