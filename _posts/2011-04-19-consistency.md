<p>Scott Young knows the <a href="http://workawesome.com/productivity/consistent/">value of consistency</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s the best way to be in shape? Exercise, for five years. What’s the best way to launch an online business? Practice running one for a decade. What’s the best approach to enhance your social life? Put yourself outside your comfort zone, every day, for years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Running and me</span></p>
<p>I hated running for most of my life. Running and I didn’t get along because, each time I got on a jogging jag, inevitably, I would have a day when I did worse than the day before. Then another. And another. So I quit.</p>
<p>I <em>hated</em> failing at running. When I stopped running, the failure stopped.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I got nutty. I decided to stop caring about my running progress. Yep, that’s right. I stopped pushing myself. I decided that I no longer cared about my time or distance. All I cared about was that running happened.</p>
<p>The result? It started happening a lot.</p>
<p>Failing at running three days a week for a year is a shit-ton better for your health than sitting still.</p>
<p>The same philosophy can be applied to almost any life context. For example, writing: People who consistently fail at writing generate more words than those that never even try.</p>
<h2>A perspective for consistent success</h2>
<p>All endeavors, in a sense, end in failure. Success happens only when you cross an arbitrarily placed finish line. A 5K is a failed 10K. A blog post is a failed book. A lemonade stand is a failed corporation. A single family home is a failed sky scraper.</p>
<p>You have more control over the finish lines in your life than you’re likely to ever realize. Set them, and cross them. Consistently.</p>
