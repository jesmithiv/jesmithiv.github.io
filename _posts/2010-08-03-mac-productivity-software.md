<p>AppStorm recently posted <a href="http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/productivity-roundups/mac-office-productivity-software/">quite a list</a>.Â  Check it out. Most of the apps are task/project/writing oriented. I would add <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html">Scrivener</a> and <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a> too.</p>
