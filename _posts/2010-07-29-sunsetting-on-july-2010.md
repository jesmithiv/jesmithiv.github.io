<p>My fingers were pretty busy this <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/07/">seventh month of 2010</a>.Â  The month started with a <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/07/01/my-relationship-and-history-with-mobile-technology-and-the-iphone/">soliloquy on my history with mobile technology and why I love the iPhone but don't own one</a>. It ended with a series on making your Mac more secure: <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/tag/perils-of-persistent-data/">Perils of persistent data</a>. And there was all kinds of rambling in between.
I'm taking a little 4-day weekend from blabbing here at Practically Efficient. Hope you're having a great summer. Be back next week.</p>
