<p>File this one under “because you can.” Brett has created a <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/pinboard-redesign-experiment/">custom style sheet</a> for <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/01/06/pinboard-the-cement-in-my-read-later-workflow/">my favorite</a> bookmark bank, <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>.  I used the ‘User CSS’ Safari extension he mentions. Nice.</p>
