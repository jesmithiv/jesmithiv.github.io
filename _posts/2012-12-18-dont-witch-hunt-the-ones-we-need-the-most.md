<blockquote>
<p>This country needs to develop a better understanding of the complexities of various conditions and respect for the profound individuality of its children. We need to emphasize that being introverted doesn’t mean one has a developmental disorder, that a developmental disorder is not the same thing as a mental illness, and that most mental illnesses do not increase a person’s tendency toward outward-directed violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said yesterday, read Susan Cain’s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307352145/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307352145&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=practiceffici-20"><em>Quiet</em></a>.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> Here in the west, we’re roughly a hundred years into a romance with extroversion. The economic and social virtues of introversion, even autism, are only now audible for a society that’s been too loquacious to care since the late 19th century.</p>

<p>But the world is changing. Today, we desperately need people who not only <em>want</em> to turn away from stimulation to think deeply about problems, but have an innate <em>passion</em> to do so. We need noise-cancelers, not more noise.</p>

<p>As any species’ environment changes, certain genetic attributes can shift from liability to asset. That’s even true of autism, though the typical workplace—filled with incessant distractions and attention-needy coworkers—<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/magazine/the-autism-advantage.html?pagewanted=all">poses a significant barrier</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[The] emerging understanding of autism may change attitudes toward autistic workers. But intelligence, even superior intelligence, isn’t enough to get or keep a job. Modern office culture — with its unwritten rules of behavior, its fluid and socially demanding work spaces — can be hostile territory for autistic people, who do better in predictable environments and who tend to be clumsy at shaping their priorities around other people’s requirements.</p>

<p>If reading books just isn’t your thing or you want a primer, watch <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts.html">her 2012 TED Talk</a>. I was lucky enough to see her give a similar talk in person last October in Washington, D.C. Her talk is great, but the book goes far deeper. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&nbsp;↩</a></p>
