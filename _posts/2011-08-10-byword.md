<p>To be fair, I’m probably not a good person to listen to when it comes to Markdown app recommendations.  I tend to try everything, and I always enjoy the chance to support anyone who develops Markdown tools.</p>
<p>And so it should shock no one what I wanted to try <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12">Byword</a> after hearing Merlin <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/25">mention it</a> on Back to Work as well as <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/7/26/byword-1.html">David’s prompt follow-up recommendation</a>.</p>
<p>After using Byword for a few weeks now, I’ve decided that it’s definitely staying in my workflow.</p>
<h2 id="whatilikeaboutbyword">What I like about Byword</h2>
<p>Byword is a well-made alternative to the other tools I use.  It doesn’t replace those other choices, but it does offer a pleasant change of scenery when my eyes need it. And it has <a href="http://prefs.org/post/8470320844/byword-app">just the right amount</a> of choices for influencing that scenery.</p>
<p>Full-screen Byword looks great in Lion, and that’s how I normally use it.  The Markdown preview also renders very well on screen.</p>
<p>Byword even <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/08/02/1l-byword-nvalt-simplenote/">integrates nicely</a> with nvALT and Simplenote, which keeps my mobile writing workflow intact.</p>
<p>I think what I like most about Byword is that has both aesthetic and utilitarian qualities.  You can use it as a “pretty” distraction-free writing environment, or you can use it to quickly convert existing Markdown files to HTML, PDF, LaTeX, RTF, or even Word.</p>
<p>Worth mentioning: The RTF export eliminates a lot of steps in <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/07/21/word-internet/">my Markdown to Word workflow</a>, too.</p>
<h2 id="mywishlistforbyword">My wish list for Byword</h2>
<p>I only have a couple of minor items:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep the Markdown editor and previewer in sync so I stay in the same place as I switch back and forth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detect Markdown in files that don’t use an .md extension. In other words, highlight Markdown syntax in existing .txt Markdown files without having to convert to .md.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you write a lot in Markdown, $10 is not a great deal of money to risk on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12">Byword</a>. Give it a try.</p>
