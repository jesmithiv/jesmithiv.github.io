<p>In the waning years of the 20th century, a marked change occurred. Everyone became a composer. It happened almost at once.</p>
<p>Humanity encountered email.</p>
<p>In the many centuries before email arrived and trumped the sun as the true center of earth’s orbit, people were trained on the art of writing hand-written letters.</p>
<p>Few, if any, people have ever been educated on the art of writing email. The overnight adoption of email allowed little time for education.</p>
<p>Education matters.</p>
<p>If you were to hand a pen to an adult that was never taught basic writing skills, the end result would probably not look that different than the scribblings of a young child. And if their peers were all the same, none of them would know how poorly the tool was being used.</p>
<p>And that’s why email is what it is today: a highly accepted but primitively used, unevolved craft.</p>
<h2 id="thewaronemail">The war on email</h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are three fronts in the war on email:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inbox management,</li>
<li>Managing the obsession with checking email, and</li>
<li>Communicating effectively.</li>
</ol>
<p>Merlin Mann branded a strategy for owning front 1: <a href="http://inboxzero.com/inboxzero/">Inbox Zero</a>. It works well, and I’ve written several posts describing how I’ve implemented Inbox Zero, like <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/17/uncomplicating-email/">how to avoid turning email into a task list</a>.</p>
<p>Front 2 has also gotten a lot more attention recently.  Email has made us primal wrecks. I’ve noted email’s ability to make us <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/15/youve-still-got-mail/">wet our pants</a>. Randy Murray sagely tells us to <a href="http://whowritesforyou.com/2010/09/07/simple-productivity-task-of-the-day-keep-it-in-your-pants/">keep it in our pants</a>.  MacSparky even spotted an <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2010/10/4/e-mail-monkey.html">email monkey</a> not long ago.</p>
<p>Fronts 1 and 2 have something in common. They're reactive, inbox-oriented strategies. Front 3 deals with your outbox. It's about proactively increasingly the quality of what you send, before you send it.</p>
<h2 id="evolvingemailpurelyforselfishreasons">Evolving email purely for selfish reasons</h2>
<p>“<a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/tag/evolving-email">Evolving email</a>” will be a series of brief posts on making email better before clicking the send button.  Each post will focus on some aspect of the art of composing email, often with examples. I use the word "art" because writing email is not scientific. It's subjective, varies greatly by context, and should ideally reflect the awareness of a compassionate human mind.</p>
<p>That's not to say that email should be an elegant art form, and I'm not out to save the planet one email at a time.  Rather, this is a utilitarian pursuit of self-interest. The primary goal is to get more value out of the time we spend pounding out letters between subject lines and signatures.</p>
<p>Some of the tips will be pretty mundane, so don’t get <em>too</em> excited. But they will all be aimed at correcting problems that I see every day—problems that should be going away but simply aren't.</p>
<p>In general, most tips will be based on the same way of thinking: put yourself in the inbox of the recipient. It may sound simple, but in practice I find that it rarely occurs; when it does, the effects can be quite profound.</p>
<p>This series will begin its evolution next week.</p>
