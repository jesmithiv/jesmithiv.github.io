<p><a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2015/12/checking-in-with-apple-watch">David Sparks</a> doesn't think the Apple Watch is going away:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wear it every day and use it to keep up with my fitness goals, set alarms and timers, check my calendar, listen to podcasts, turn on and off the lights, get directions, text my kids, and checkoff tasks. Oh yes … I also use it to tell time. This is the most useful watch I’ve ever owned. I put it on when I wake up in the morning and take it off when I go to bed. (That’s right, I even keep it on while I’m in my pajamas.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm glad I'm not the only one. One other worth mentioning: it's the most useful weather checker ever devised. </p>
