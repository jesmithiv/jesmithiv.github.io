<p>In case you missed it, Dr. Drang wrote a <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/07/evaluating-latex-with-eddie-and-alpha/">nice response</a> to <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/home/2014/7/10/latex-alfred-wolfram">my post on evaluating LaTeX with Alfred and Wolfram Alpha</a>. Though he doesn't use Alfred, the Professor of Python does write a lot of LaTeX, and it would shock no one that knows of him to learn that he quickly cooked up some <code>.py</code> to query Wolfram Alpha from BBEdit. </p><p>For whatever reason, today I felt the urge to make a good thing better, and it occurred to me that someone out there on the internet had probably made a Wolfram workflow with more bells and whistles than the stock Wolfram workflow that ships with Alfred.</p><p>Sure enough, a little web search turned up <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/04/alfred-2-workflows-i-use.html">a post</a> from (of course) my good friend Gabe at Macdrifter, who pointed to me such a workflow written by David Ferguson.</p><p><a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/655-wolframalpha-workflow/">David's workflow</a> returns Wolfram results <em>live</em> to the Alfred interface without even having to go to the Wolfram site at all.</p><p>In early testing, it works flawlessly with standard LaTeX input. For example, here's the 1.9602 I was trying to get in the last post:</p>

<p>Pressing <code>⌥↩</code> even puts the numerical result on my clipboard. So yes, this is a way to evaluate LaTeX expressions right in Alfred without having to even lose sight of your LaTeX code. </p>

<p>You do need a Wolfram app ID for this to work, but you can get one free <a href="https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html">here</a>.</p>
