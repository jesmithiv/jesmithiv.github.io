<p>If you're like me, you happily handed over $10 to upgrade to <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel 3</a>. It’s packed with new features, one of which caught my eye immediately: <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/whatsnew.html">nested conditions</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it took me a while to figure out how to create these nests of compulsive automation. I just couldn't figure out how to make new "if" lines. But after some digging, I found what I was looking for in a help file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>To create a nested condition:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Hold down the alt/option key. The plus (+) button will change to show ellipses (…).</li>
<li>Click on the ellipses button above where you want to create the nested condition.</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold down the plus button for the condition above hwere [sic] you want to create the nested condition. While holding the button down, you will see an indicator and then a menu with extra options.</li>
<li>Select “Add nested condition”.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>If this saves you a few minutes on your way to saving even more time with Hazel, great.</p>
