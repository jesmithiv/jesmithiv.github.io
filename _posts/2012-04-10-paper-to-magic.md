<p>One of the first things I did after upgrading from the iPad 1 to the new iPad was dash to the App Store to find a scanning app. I had already been using my iPhone to create PDFs from photos of documents, and I wanted to do the same with the new iPad.</p>
<p>I came up empty. I think that because the iPad 2’s camera was so poor, no one cared enough to create iPad-optimized versions of scanning apps.</p>
<p>But now, several weeks after the dawn of the the new iPad, things seem to be changing. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-scan-multipage/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a> ($7), my favorite iPhone scanning app, is now iPad-ready. Version 4.0 is fantastic.</p>
<p>I really like the simple, intuitive interface for cropping pages. I can’t really describe it in words, but the cropping area just naturally moves with your finger. Very fast, fluid, and efficient.</p>
<p>Building multi-page PDFs is also very easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take photo</li>
<li>Crop</li>
<li>Tap done</li>
<li>Repeat for each page</li>
</ol>
<p>You can file the resulting PDFs into folders, email them, or send them to Dropbox, Evernote, and more.</p>
<p>Scanner Pro is blazingly fast on the new iPad. The camera launches almost instantly, takes photos quickly, and PDF processing happens in split seconds.<a id="fnref:1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Now that the new iPad has an iPhone 4S-grade camera, it functions remarkably well as a portable scanner. There’s just something <em>right</em> about being able to preview my scans on the iPad’s larger, Retina screen. It almost feels like I’m lifting a piece of paper off the table and into the digital world.</p>
<h2 id="andthisisjustthebeginning">And this is just the beginning</h2>
<p>I'm more smitten with the iPad every day. Just think: you can turn a paper page into PDF in seconds, open it in an app like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpen/id490774625?mt=8">PDFpen for iPad</a> to annotate and sign it, then send it to someone. All without touching a PC.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure even non-geeks could get excited about that, though I would need to observe one in the wild to be sure. I wonder if <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/153082/chris-pirillos-dad-utterly-defeated-by-windows-8-video/">Chris Pirillo’s father</a> is available.</p>

<p>The makers of Scanner Pro also rebuilt the PDF processing engine in the iPhone version. Version 4.0 is noticeably faster on the iPhone as well. <a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:1"> ↩</a></p>
