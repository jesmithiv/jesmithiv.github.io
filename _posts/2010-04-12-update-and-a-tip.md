<p>Because of some other writing projects, I've fallen a bit behind on this blog. But fear not. I recently wrote a post on one of my other blogs that you may be interested in.
Do you want a better way to keep up with blogs and other sites that change frequently? Are you tired of having to manually go to individual sites to see if they've been updated?</p>
<p>If so, take a look at my recent post "<a href="http://risk20.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/a-simpler-way-to-keep-up-with-the-dynamic-web/">A simpler way to keep up with the dynamic web</a>" at Risk + 2.0.</p>
