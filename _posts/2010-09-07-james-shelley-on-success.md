<p>James Shelley recently wrote a very thought-provoking piece on the concept of <a href="http://www.inventingaplanet.com/success/">success</a>.
I attempted several times to provide a block quote from this marvelous article, but I decided that it wouldn’t do it justice. I recommend reading the whole thing.</p>
<p>To me, true, pure success falls into two main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>As an individual, you experience the feeling of success through progress. Life is a series of tweaks and refinements. It’s about being a little better each day and seeking fulfillment in the <em>means</em> you take to your end. Voids always succeed the attainment of material goals.</li>
<li>As a member of the human race, success is ultimately defined by your ability to help others feel successful and important.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, the more you view success as a collection of experiences, not objects, the better off you are.</p>
