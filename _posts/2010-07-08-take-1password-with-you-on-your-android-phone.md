<p>Earlier this year, I wrote a <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/tag/passwords/">series on passwords</a>, and I recommended <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/05/10/1password-my-top-recommendation-for-password-management-and-online-security/">1Password</a> as my favorite password manager. One virtue of a great password manager is portability.
Until now, 1Password mobile apps were only available for the iPhone and iPad. Now, you can take 1Password with you on your Droid, EVO, Nexus One, or other Android phone too.</p>
<p>The Android app is pretty crude and still in beta. It's read-only, meaning that you can see all of your passwords, but you can't add any. To get your passwords in, you'll need to manually copy your 1Password keychain to your phone over a USB connection. It's not hard, and full instructions are in <a href="http://blog.agile.ws/post/777806427/1password-is-available-for-android">Agile's blog</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sure the 1Password Android app will get better and better. This is great news for those of us that use 1Password but don't have an iPhone.</p>
