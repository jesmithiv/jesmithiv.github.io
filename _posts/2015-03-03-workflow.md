<p>If David Sparks were an app, he would probably be called Workflow. But I know for a fact he isn't an app. I <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/markdown/id622433972?mt=11&amp;at=10laz7&amp;ct=blog">co-wrote a book</a> with him and even had dinner with him in person once. He's a real person. A real, nice person, that is.</p>

<p>At this point, it would be impossible to quantify all of the positive  effects David's had on the life of anyone who's touched a piece of software he advocatesâ€”even people who have never heard of him.</p>

<p>So fortunately for the creators of the <em>iOS app</em> <a href="https://my.workflow.is">Workflow</a>, David's not an app, but rather an app-loving human who made an amazing video Field Guide about all the amazing things Workflow can do.</p>

<p>If you're at all Workflow-curious, watch a <a href="https://vimeo.com/120959211">free video sample</a> of <em>The Workflow Video Field Guide</em>, <a href="http://macsparky.com/workflowapp">read more</a> about it at David's site, then <a href="http://macsparky.fetchapp.com/sell/sheiraec">buy it</a>.</p>

<p>Buy it to learn how to use Workflow. Buy it to enjoy an exceptionally well-produced video. Buy it to support a guy who's probably already given you more than you can pay back.</p>
