<p>My fling with sans-serif fonts turned out to be short-lived. PE's new design makes heavy use of my favorite serif typeface for the web, Georgia, a font that also has a lot of special meaning to me personally.
I am not a great designer. Not even a good designer. But I like to think I've developed a sense for what's not needed. And I've gotten better at acting on that sense.</p>
<p>Generally, this redesign was about subtraction.</p>
<p>I've also redesigned my approach to writing here. Going forward, posting will probably be more erratic and less routine. I feel as though I've reached a tipping point here. I'm also deploying some of the dividends I've been paid here in other pursuits.</p>
<p>More on that later. Hopefully.</p>
