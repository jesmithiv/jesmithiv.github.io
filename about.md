Practically Efficient—an amalgamation of posts on technology, productivity, and the highly imperfect pursuit of personal betterment—is written by me, Eddie Smith.

This site is the main place I write, and I do it for free because most of the value to me is getting my thoughts straight. I've written a few other noteworthy things, namely [co-authoring a book about Markdown][md]. I've also written for [Macworld.com][mw].

I'm a credentialed actuary and director at [The Infinite Actuary][tia], a company that provides educational products for actuaries. I've volunteered with the Society of Actuaries (SOA) and previously chaired the Technology Section of the SOA. I live in Greenville, South Carolina with my wife and two kids.

The best way to follow Practically Efficient is by subscribing to the [RSS feed][rss] or following [@PractEff][t] on Twitter. The best way to contact me is through my personal Twitter, [@eddie_smith][t2], or [email][e].
